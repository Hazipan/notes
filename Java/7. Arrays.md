# Intro

	• Rather than using 5 lines of code to outline 5 different values, we can use an array
	• An array stores data in a list
		○ It will hold a fixed number of values of one type
	• Each index of an array corresponds with a different value
	
	
			Elements	4	8	15	16	23
			Indices	0	1	2	3	4
			
		○ Notice that the indexes start at 0
		○ This array has a length of 5 since it holds 5 elements
			§ But the highest index is 4

# Creating Arrays 

	• We want to create a list of clothing items and their corresponding prices
	• To create an array that will do this, we first declare the type of data that it holds

		double[] price;
		
	• The we can explicitly initialize the array to contain the data we want to store

		prices = {13.15, 15.87, 14.22, 16.66};
		
	• Just like with simple variables, we can declare and initialize at the same time

		double[] prices = {13.15, 15.87, 14.22, 16.66};
		
	• We can use array to hold String values and other objects as well as primitives

		String[] clothingItems = {"Tank Top", "Beanie", "Funny Socks", "Corduroys"};

# Importing Arrays

	• If you printed an array (i.e. System.out.println(clothingItems);) you get a memory address
		○ Not helpful!
	• If we want a more descriptive printout of the array we need a toString() method that is provided by the Arrays package in Java

		import java.util.Arrays;
		
		○ Put this at the tip of file, before declaring the class
	• When we import a package, we are making all the mehtods of that package available in our code
	• The Arrays package has many usful methods, including Arrays.toString()
		○ When we pass an array into Arrays.toString(), we can see the contents of the array printed out.

		import java.util.Arrays;
		
		public class Lottery{
			public static void main(String[] args) {
				int[] lotteryNumbers = {4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42};
				System.out.println(Array.toString(lotteryNumbers);
			}
		}
		
		○ This code would print: [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42] 

# Get Elements By Index

	• Once you have an array declared and initialized, you can access specific values using brackets
		
		double price[] = {13.1, 15.87, 14.22, 16.66};
		System.out.println(price[1]);
		
		○ Would print: 15.87
	• Remember, the index begins at 0, so index 1 would be the second value

# Creating Empty Arrays

	• We can create emtpy arrays an then fill them in, item by item
		○ Empty arrays must be initialized with a fixed length
	
		String[] menuItems = new String[5];
		
		○ Once you declare the size, it cannot be changed
	• After initializeing it, we can see each index item

		menuItems[0] = "Hot Dog";
		menuItems[1] = "Potato Salad";
		menuItems[2] = "Cornbread";
		menuItems[3] = "Baked Potato";
		menuItems[4] = "Vanilla Ice Cream";
		
		○ This has the same effect as assigning the entire array at once
	• You can reassing the value of an index by re-stating it

		menuItems[4] = "Chocolate Ice Cream";
		
		○ Now, menuItems[4] stores Chocolate Ice Cream instead of Vanilla Ice Cream
	• When using new to create an empty array, all the indices will be assigned a value depending on the data type

		Data Type	Initialized Value
		int	0
		double	0.0
		boolean	false
		Refence	null

# Length

	• If we want to quickly see how many elements an array has, we can access the length field of the array object

		String[] menuItems = new String[5];
		System.out.println(menuItems.length);
		
		○ This would print: 5

# `String[] args`

	• String[] is an array made up of String objects
	• The args parameter is part of the String array
		○ In this case, the array args contains the argument that we pass in from the terminal when we run the class file
			§ So far, args has been empty

		public class HelloYou {
			public static void main(String[] args) {
				System.out.println("Hello " + args[0]);
			}
		}
		
		○ We can run the file HelloYou in the terminal, with an argument
		
		java HelloYou Aaron
		
		○ We would get: Hello Aaron
	• The String[] args would be interpreted as an array with 1 element, "Aaron"
	• When we use args[0] in the main() method, we can access that element
