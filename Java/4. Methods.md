# Intro

	• You give objects behaviors by using methods
	• Using the example of a Savings Account program
		○ The state would tell uswhat the accout should know
			§ The blance of money available
		○ The behavior tells us what the account should be able to do
			§ Depost
			§ Withdraw
			§ Check the balance
	• Methods are repeatable, modular blocks of code used to accomplish specific tasks
	• Method Decomposition - we can use methods to break down a large problem into smaller, more manageable problems
	• Procedural Abstraction is where someone knows what a method does but not how it does it

# Defining Methods

	• If we were to define a checkBalance() method, it would look like this:

		public void checkBalance() {
			System.out.println("Hello!);
			System.out.println("Your balance is " + balance);
		}
	
		○ public void checkBalance() is the mehtod declaration
			§ public means that other classes can access the method
			§ void means that there is not specific output
			§ checkBalane() is the name of our method
	• Every method has its own method signature which is made up of the method name and its parameters
		○ In this case, its checkBalance()
	• Anything that can be done in the main() method can be done in other  methods
	• checkBalane() is considerd non-static, unlike main()

# Calling Methods

	• When you add a non-static method, you can use it on an object if both are in the same class
		○ We must call the method on the object
	• Using the Car class, we'll add a startEngine() method
		○ We'll call startEngine() on myFastCar

		class Car {
			String color;
			
			public Car(String carColor){ <- constructor method
				color = carColor;
			}
			public void startEngine(){ <- new method
				System.out.println("Starting the car!");
				System.out.println("Vroom!");
			}
			public static void main(String[] args){
				Car myFastCar = new Car("red); <- creating the object
				myFastCar.startEngine(); <- calling the method on the object
			}
		}
	
		○ First we referene the object myFastCar
		○ The we use (.) and call the method startEngine()
			§ You must include the () when calling a method
	• Code generally runs from top to bottom
		○ Methods are ignored by the compiler unless they are called
		○ Once called, the comiler executes every line in the method

# Scope

	• A method is a task that an object or class performs
	• We mark the domain of a method using curly bracers {}
		○ The domain of a method is also called the scope
	• You cannot access variables that are outside the scope of the method
If the variable is declared inside the class, then all methods can use it because it's in the scope of the entire class

# Adding Parameters

	• If we want to use variables from other methods, we add parameters
		○ Similar to constructor methods

			public Car {
				String color;
				
				public Car(String carColor){
					color = carColor;
				}
				public void startRadio(double stationNum, String stationName){ 
					System.out.println("Tuning to " + stationNum + ", " + stationName + "!");
					System.out.println("Enjoy!");
				}
				public static void main(String[] args){
					Car myCar =  new Car ("red");
					myCar.startRadio(103.7, "Meditation Station"); 
				}
			}
			
	• When calling on a mthod with multiple parameters, the arguments in the call must be in the same order that they appear in the signature
	• Method Overloading allows us to have multiple methods with the same name so long as they each have a unique signature

# Reassigning Fields

	• When using a method to change the value of an instance, reassign the value with =

		public void deposit(double amountToDeposit){
			double updatedBalance = balance + amountToDeposit;
			balance = updatedBalance; <- reassigning the value of the instance
}

# Returns

	• You can use a value outside of the method it was created in if you return it
			
			public int numberOfTires(){
				int tires = 4;
				//return statement
				return tires;
			}

		○ This method returns the value 4
		○ Once the return statement is executed, the compiler exits the function
		○ Any code after the return statement is ignored
	• Here we replace void with int to signigy that the return type is an int value
		○ void means "completely empty" to indicate that no value is returned
	• A non-void method returns a value when it is called
		○ you can specify any datatype to be returned
	• If the return type is compatible with the return statement, a copy of the value gets returned in a process called return by value
	• Non-void methods cane be used as a variable value or as part of an expression

			public static void main(String[] args){
				Car myCar = new Car("red");
				int numTires = myCar.numberOfTires();
			}
		
		○ Sine numberOfTires() returns 4, we can store the value in the variable 

# AP Concept

	• We learned about returning primitive datatypes, but you can also return objects
		○ It works differently
		○ When an object is returned, we return a reference to the object, not a copy of the object
		○ You can use an object as a parameter
Returning an object requires multiple calsses

class CarLot {
	Car carInLot;
	
	public CarLot(Car givenCar){
		carInLot = givenCar;
	}
	public Car returnACar(){
		//return Car object
		return carInLot;
	}
	public static void main(String [] args){
		Car myCar = new Car("red");
		System.out.println(myCar);
		CarLot myCarLot = new CarLot(myCar);
		System.out.println(myCarLot.returnACar());
	}
}

class Car {
	String color;
	
	public Car(String carColor){
		color = carColor;
	}
	
	public static main(String[] args){
		Car myCar = new Car("red");
}

# toString()

	• Use the toString() method to return a string so that when you print an object you get more than just a memory

		class Car {
			String color;
			
			public Car(String carColor){
				color = carColor;
			}
			public static void main (String[] args){
				Car myCar = new Car("red");
				System.out.println(myCar); <- would normally print memory address
			}
			public String toString(){
				return "This is a " + color + " car!"; <- makes myCar print the String
			}
}
