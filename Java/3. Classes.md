# Classes

	• A class is the set of instructions that describe how an instance can behave and what information in containts
	• The term public is an access level modifier that allows other classes to interact with it

			public class Car {
				public static void main(String[] args) {
				}
			}
		○ This creates a custom class called Car
		○ The class has a main() method which lists the tasks performed
			§ main() runs when we execute the compiled Car.class
	• An instance of a class is called an object
		○ To create an object, you use a constructor method
			
			public class Car {
				public Car() {
					//instructions for creating a Car instance
				}
				public static void main(String[] args) {
					//invoke the constructor method
					Car ferrari = new Car();
				}
			}
		○ Instead of using a primitive data type for ferrari, it is declared as a reference data type
			§ This means that the value of the variable ferrari is a reference to an instance's memory address
			§ The class name is used as the variable's type
		○ After the = we invoke the constructor method Car() and use the keyword new to indicate we're creating an instance of the Car object
			§ omitting new causes an error
		○ If you were to ouput the value of ferrari, we would see its memory address
			§ Something like: Car@76ed5528
	• You can initialize  a reference-type variable without assigning it a reference by using null
		○ null has no value
		○ If you were to assign null to an object, it would have a void reference
			
			Car thunderbird = new Car();
			System.out.println(thunderbird);//prints something similar to: Car@76ed5528
			
			thunderbird = null; //changes value to null
			System.out.println(thunderbird); //Prints: null
		○ If you use a null reference to call a method or access an instance variable, you'll receive a NullPointerException error

# Example

public class Store { <- Creation of a new class called Store
	public Store() { <- Start of new constructor method
		System.out.println("I am inside the constructor method"); <- Syntax to be run when the constructor method is invoked
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) { <- Start of main() method were we can create instances of the Store object
		System.out.println("Start of main method");
		Store lemonadeStand = new Store(); <- Invocation of the constructore method, Store(), to create a new instance
		System.out.println(lemonadeStand); <- Syntax to print the value of lemonadeStand which will produce its memory address
	}
}

Output:
	Start of main method
	I am inside of the constructor method
	Store@2aae9190
	
	• Running the program invokes main()
	• We created an instance of the Store object so we move from main() to Store()
	• The code inside Store() runs
	• After it runs, we return to main() and continue from were we left off

# Instance Fields

	• When you print an instance, it will ouput a loation in the computers's memory.
		○ This isn't useful
		○ It does that because the instane has no other characteristics
	• When an object is created, the constructor sets up the initial state of the object
		○ The state is made up of associated data that represents the characcteristis of an objet
		○ We add data to objects with instance variables and instance fields
	• We want multiple Car instances, but of vaious colors
		○ To do this we can declare a String color instance field
			§ Instance variables are described as a "has-a" relationship
				□ A Car "has-a" color
				□ Nouns and adjectives associated with an object
			public class Car { 
				String color; <- declaration of an instance field (type then name)
				
				public Car() { <- we will assign instance variables here to create parameters
				}
				
				public static void main(String[] args) {
				}
			}
		○ The declaration of the instance field is within the class, not within a method, and the instance variable will be available for assignment inside the constructor
	• Instance fields are a type of state that each instance will possess
		○ One may have "red" as its color, but another could have "blue"
		○ It's the job of the construtor method to give instance fields initial value

# Constructor Parameters

	• To create objects with dynamic, individual states, you'll use a combination of constructor methods and instance fields
	• To assign a value to an instance, alter the constructor to include parameters so that it can access data that is assigned to an instance
			
			public class Car {
				String color; <- Declared instance field
				
				public Car(String carColor) { <- constructor method with parameter
					carColor = color; <- parameter value assigned to an instance field
				}
				
				public static void main(String[] args) {
				}
			}
		○ The Car() constructor method now has a parameter: String carColor
		○ When a String value gets passes into Car(), it is assigned to the parameter carColor
		○ Inside the constructor method, carColor will be assigned to the instance variable color
	• Out Car() method also has a signature which defines the name and parameters of the method
		○ The signature for the Car() method is Car(String color)

	• There are 2 types of parameters: formal parameters and actual parameters
		○ a formal parameter specifies the type and name of data that can be passed into a method
			§ Car(String carColor) has a formal parameter
		○ An actual parameter is used when we invoke the constructor
			§ We learn how to do that on the next page
	• A class can have multiple constructor methods as long as they have different parameter values because java can use constructor overloading
		○ Signatures are how the computer differentiate between methods
			
			public class Car {
				Sting color;
				int mpg;
				boolean isElectric;
				
				pubic Car(String carColor, int milesPerGallon) { <- Constructor 1
					color = carColor;
					mpg = milesPerGallon;
				}
				
				public Car(boolean electricCar, int milesPerGallon) { <- Constructor 2
					isElectric = electricCar;
					mpg = milesPerGallon;
				}
			}
		○ The computer knows which constructor to use by looking at the types of values we pass into it
			§ Car myCar = new Car(true, 40); will use the second constructor because we used the data types boolean and int which only matches up with the second constructor

# Putting Value to Fields

	• Once a constructor method has parameters, you can pass values into it by calling it from the main() method
		○ These values are known as arguments
		○ Once they're passed into the constructor, they're used to give instance fields an initial value
			
			public class Car {
				String color;
				
				public Car(String carColor) {
					color = carColor; <- assignment of value to an instance field
				}
				public static void main(String[] args)
					Car ferrari = new Car("red"); <- value of parameter is supplied when we call the constructor
				}
			}
		○ Here we created a new instance, ferrari, in the main() method with "red" as its color field
		○ We pass "red" to the constructor method by calling new Car("red")
			§ The value types in the invocation must match the type declaration in the parameters
		○ Inside the constructor, parameter carColor refers to "red" that was passed in the invocation, and the value is assigned to the instance field color
			§ color has already been declared, so we don't specify the type during assignment of the value
		○ The object, ferrari, holds the state of color as an instance field referencing the value "red"
		○ We can access the value of this field using the dot operator (.)
			§ To access a field, use objectName.fieldName
			§ ferrari.color = "red"

# Example

```java
public class Store {
	//instance fields that outline data types that can be assigned
	String product;
	int count;
	double price;
	
	//constructor method
	public Store(String productType, int inventoryCount, double productPrice) {
    /* constructor parameters that allow the constructor to access data that is assigned to an instance */
    product = productType;
		count = inventoryCount;
		price = productPrice;         
	}
	
	//main method
	public static void main(String [] args) {
    //  instances of objects that invoke the Store() constructor method
		Store cookieShop = new Store("cookies", 12, 3.75);   
		Store pastryShop = new Store("pastry", 30, 2.50);              

    //prints the specific values of the object
		System.out.println(cookieShop.product);        
		System.out.println(pastryShop.price);
	}
}
```
