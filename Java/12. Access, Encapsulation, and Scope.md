# Intro

	• AES = Access, Ecapsulation, and Scope
	• As our programs get bigger, we will begin to have multiple objects and classes that interact with each other
	• Access and Scope both center around what parts of you programs can interact with specific variables or methods from other parts of the program
	• This section covers:
				Access
		○ The private and public keywords and how they relate to Classes, variables, constructors, and methods
		○ The concept of encapsulation
		○ Accessor methods (a.k.a. "getters")
		○ Mutator methods (a.k.a. "setters")
				Scope
		○ Local variables vs. instance variables
The this keyword

# The `public` keyword

	• public and private define what parts of you code have access to other parts of your code
	• We can define access to many parts of our code
		○ Instance variables, methods, constructors, and classes
		○ If we declare these as public, any part of our code (even other classes) can access them
	• We declare something public by using the public keyword in the declaration statement

		public class Dog { <- public used for a class
			public String name; <- public used for an instance field 
			public int age;
			
			public Dog(String nameInput, int ageInput) { <- public used for a constructor
				name = nameInput;
				age = ageInput;
			}
			
			public void speak() { <- public used for a method
				System.out.println("Woof!")
		}
	
		○ Since everything about a Dog is public, any other class can access anything about a Dog
	• Example:

		public class DogSchool {
			public void makeADog() {
				Dog cujo = new Dog("Cujo", 7); <- accessing the constructor
				System.out.println(cujo.age); <- accessing an instance field
				cujo.speak; <- accessing a method
			}
		}
		
	• Classes and constructors will almost always be public

# `private` and Encapsulation

	• If an instance variable of method is marked as private, then you'll only be able to access them from inside the class that they're already in
	• This is useful to encapsulate our code into bundles of logic
		○ A bank object doesn't need to know the inner workings of a checking accout, only a select few functions of the checking account
		○ By using private, we can segment/encapsulate our code into individual units
