# Variables Explained
	• Variables are used to store information in Java
		○ Variables are used to name values so that we can use it later
	• Variables give context to our information
		○ For example, the number 8 could mean anything
			§ How many socks you have, a rating out of 10, etc.
		○ If you store the number 8 in a variable, then the name of the Variable will give context to the value
	• In Java, the type of data you're storing will determine which Variable you use.
		○ There are 5 types of Variables we've learned so far:
			§ int, double, boolean, char, and String
	• To use a Variable, you declare them in Syntax
		○ Declare the Variable type, then the Variable name
		○ int age;
		○ double salaryRequirement;
		○ boolean isEmployed;
	• You can then assign the value of the Variable by using an assignment operator such as =
		○ age = 85; stores the value 85 into the Variable age
		○ When code is used to represent a fixed value, it's known as a literal
	• You can also declare the value and assign its value in the same line
		○ int age = 85;
	• Once you have a variable declared you can use println() to output the assigned value
		○ System.out.println(age); will have the out put of 85 since that is the assigned value

# Types of Variables

int
	• The int Variable is used to store integers
		○ Whole numbers between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,648
double
	• The double Variable is used to store decimal numbers as well as very large and very small numbers.
	• From 1.7976931348623157 E+308 down to 4.9 E-324
boolean
	• The boolean Variable can only hold one of two values: true or false
		○ They will be used to help our program navigate decisions.
char
	• The char Variable is used to hold a single character
		○ Letters, spaces, or punctuation marks
		○ The value must be surrounded by single quotes
			§ char grade = 'A';
String
	• int, double, boolean, and char are all primitive Variables
		○ Primitive Variables are data types with no built-in behavior
	• String Variables are objects, not primitives
		○ Objects do have built-in behaviors
	• The String Variable can hold a sequence of characters
		○ String greeting = "Hello World";
	• There are 2 ways to use String
		1. Use the String as a literal
		2. Call the String class to create a new String object
	• String as a literal is using the String to represent a fixed value
		○ String greeting = "Hello World";
		○ This makes String act like a primitive
	• You can also create a new String object by calling the String class when declaring a String
		○ String salutations = new String("Hello World");
	• Both do essentially the same thing but with subtle differences
		○ I don't get to know what those differences are yet. We'll be using String as a literal for now.
Escape Sequences
	• Some symbols will have an alternate use when used in a Java print statement
	• Escape characters begin with a \
		○ \" allow us to add " marks to a String value
			§ System.out.print("\"Hello World"\"); outputs "Hello World"
		○ \\ allows us to add a \ to a String value
			§ System.out.print("C:\\users"); outputs C:\users
		○ \n will output a new line
			§ System.out.println("Hello\nGoodbye"); outputs Hello
											Goodbye
Naming Variables
	• What you name a variable is important
		○ You should make sure that it makes sense for what the stored value is
		○ That way it is easier for you and others to read and comprehend you code
	• A Variable name must start with a letter, $, or _
		○ No other symbols or numbers
	• When naming Variables, it's best o use camelCase
		○ First word is lowercase
		○ Each word after it begins with a capital letter
		○ No spaces
			§ That would make the name invalid
		○ Underscores shouldn't be used to separate words.

# Static Checking

	• Java uses what is called static typing
		○ Java programs will not compile if a variable is assigned an incorrect type
		○ This creates a bug, specifically a type declaration bug
	• Bugs cause code to crash or produce an incorrect result
	• Static typing helps detect bugs during compiling so that we can catch them in programming rather than in the execution of the code
		○ int greeting = "Hello World";
		
		Error: incompatible types: String cannot be converted to int
			int greeting = "Hello World";
	• If a bug isn't caught at compilation, then the code will crash causing a runtime error

# Manipulating Variables

	• You can use expression, arithmetic operators, and more to change variables
	
			double balance = 2107.76;
			double deposit = 369.87;
			balance = balance + deposit;
			
	• The data type of an expression is determined by the resulting value
		○ Two int values will evaluate to an int value
		○ Two double values will evaluate into a double value
	• Addition and subtraction can be done in double and int values
	• We can also use increment operators to add or subtract 1 from a value
		○ Use ++ to add 1 | numPics++; would increase variable numPics by 1
		○ Use -- to subtract 1 | numPics--; would decrease variable numPics by 1
	• Multiplication and division also works in double and int values
		○ Use * to multiply and / to divide
		○ If you divide an int value, it will lose any remainder because an int cannot store decimals
		○ Dividing by 0 will cause an ArithmeticException error
		○ Be sure to use () to ensure PEMDAS is followed in the desired way
	• The modulo operator (%) can be used to get just the remainder of a division
	
			int cookies = 10;
			int cookiesLeftOver = 10 % 3;
			Would equal 1
			
	• You can use compound assignment operators to change the value of a variable
		○ That way you don't have to use var = var + x
		○ Use += for addition
		○ Use -= for subtraction
		○ Use *= for multiplicaiton
		○ Use /= for division
		○ Use %= for modulo
	• Java has relational operators for numeric datatypes that make boolean comparisons
		○ This means you can use > or < to create a boolean value
		
			boolean canBut = cost < bankBalance;
			
		○ To do = and ≠ use == and !=
		○ To do ≥ or ≤ use >= or <=
	• You cannot use math symbols to compare or edit String values
		○ Use .equals() to compare String values
		
			String person1 = "Paul";
			String person2 = "John";
			System.out.print(person1.equals(person2));
			Will output 'false'
			
		○ You can use + or - too

		
			String username = "hazipan";
			System.out.print("Your username is: " + username);
							Or
			int balance = 10000;
			String message = "Your balance is: " + balance;
			System.out.print(message);

	• You can declare a value that cannot be manipulated by using final
	
			final int yearBorn = 2001;
			
		○ If you try to manipulate a final value, there will be an error during compiling
