# Intro

	• We can have an Array of objects
		○ Arrays are objects
		○ We can have an array of arrays

		[ [ 1,2,3 ], [ 4,5,6 ], [7,8,9] ]
		
	• These are called 2D arrays, since we can logically think about them as a two-dimensional matrix containing rows and columns

		[ 1, 2, 3 ]
		[ 4, 5, 6 ]
		[ 7, 8, 9 ]
		
	• We can even have 2D arrays that are not rectangular
		○ These are called jagged arrays

		[ [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ], [ 5, 6 ], [ 7, 8, 9 ] ]
		
		can be represented as
		
		[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
		[ 5, 6 ]
		[ 7, 8, 9 ]
	
		○ We wont cover jagged arrays, but remember that you can use them
	• Why use 2D arrays?
		○ To store and organize data by rows and colums, like exporting data to a spreadsheet
		○ To condense multiple arrays down to a single variable
			§ i.e. 10 students, each with 10 quiz socres as a 10x10 2D array
		○ To map out data.
			§ A tic-tac-toe game can have its state represented by a 3x3 2D array
	• The main downside is that arrays cannot be added to after they are initialized

# Declaration, Initialization, and Assignment

	• When declareing a 2D array, the format is similar to a 1D array, except you use a second set of brackets after the data type

		int [][] twoDArray;
		
		○ You can think of it as  creating an array ([]) of interger arrays (int[])
	• When initializing 2D arrays, you define its size
		○ This is defferent form normal arrays: instead of only including the number of elemtents, you also indicate how many elements are going to be in the sub-arrays
		○ Think of it as number of rows and columns
		
		int[][] intArray;
		intArray = new int[ 3 ][ 5 ]; ->
		
	• If you already know the values you want in the array, you can initialize it and write values into it all at once

		int[][] numbers = { { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }, { 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }, { 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 } };

# Accessing Elements

	• Same as normal arrays, it just needs 2 indecis instead of 1
	
		int[][] data = { { 2, 4, 6 }, { 8, 10, 12 }, { 14, 16, 18 } };
		int stored = data[ 0 ][ 2 ]; -> stores 6 (think [row/subarray], [column/element])

# Modifying Elements

	• Same as a normal array, you just need 2 indecis instead of 1

		data[ 0 ][ 2 ] = 7;

	• You can also create an empty 2D array and then assign values a you go
		
		int[][] data = new int[ 4 ][ 3 ];
		
		data[ 3 ][ 2 ] = 16;
		data[ 0 ][ 0 ] = 4;              ->
		data[ 2 ][ 1 ] = 12;
		data[ 1 ][ 1 ] = 8;

[ 4, 0, 0]
[ 0, 8, 0]
[ 0, 12, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 16 ]

# Traversing a 2D Array

	• We can access each subarray using a loop

		char[][] letterBlock = { {'a', 'b', 'c' }, { 'd', 'e', 'f' }, { 'g', 'h', 'i' }, { 'j', 'k', 'l' } };
		
		for( int index = 0; index < letterBlock.length; index++ )
		{
			System.out.println( Arrray.toString(letterBlock[ index ] ) + "\n" );
		}
		
		Output:
			[a, b, c]
			[d, e, d]
			[g, h, i]
			[j, k, l]

	• We can use nested loops to access the elements of subarrays
	• In order to find the number of elements in the outer array, we just need the length of the 2D array
		
		int lengthOfOuterArray = letterBlock.length;
		
		○ When you think in matrix form, this is the height (number of rows)
	• In order to find the number of elements in a subarray, we can get the length of the subarray after it's been recalled from the outer array
		○ Remember how to retrieve a subarray
		
		char[] subArray = letterBlock[ 0 ];
		
		○ Therefore, we can use this to retrieve the length:
		
		int lengthOfSubarray = letterBlock[ 0 ].length;
		
		○ When thinking in matrix form, this is the width (number of columns)
	• Put it all together:
	
		for( int a = 0; a < letterBlock.length; a++ )
		{
			for( int b = 0; b < letterBlock[ a ].length; b++ )
			{
				System.out.print( "Accessed: " + letterBlock[ a ][ b ] + "\t" );
			}
			System.out.println();
		}
		
	• You can use enhanced for, while, and do-while loops as well, but it gets cumbersome
		○ It's usually bes to use regular for loops
	• Fo a for-each (enhanced for) loop
		
		char[ ][ ] charData = { {'a', 'b', 'c' }, { 'd', 'e', 'f' }, { 'g', 'h', 'i' }, { 'j', 'k', 'l' } };
		
		for( char[ ] charRow : charData)
		{
			for( char c : charRow)
			{
				System.out.print( c + " " );
			}
			System.out.println();
		}
		
	• Using a while loop:

		int i = 0, j = 0;
		while( i < charData.length )
		{
			j = 0;
			while( j < charData[ i ].length )
			{
				System.out.print( charData[ i ][ j ] + " " );
				j++;
			}
			System.out.println();
			i++;
		}

# Row and Column Major order

	• Our loops have so far been in row-major order meaning we iterate through the rows (left to right) rather than the columns (up to down)
		○ To get column-major order, swap the termination condition of the inner and outer loop

		int stepCount = 0;
		for( int a = 0; a < matrix[ 0 ].length; a++ )
		{
			for( int b = 0; b <matrix.length; b++ )
			{
				System.out.print( "Step: " + stepCount );
				System.out.print( " Element: " + matrix[ a ][ b ] );
				System.out.println();
				stepCount++;
			}
		}

# Combining Traversal and Conditional Operators

	• Some ways conditional logic can affect 2D traversal
		○ Skipping or selecting certain rows and columns
		○ Modifying elements if they meet certain conditions
		○ Complex calculations using the 2D array data
		○ Formatting the 2D array
		○ Avoiding exceptions/smart processing
	• Example: a calendar app that users can input events into
		○ Represented by a 5x7 2D array
		○ We want (1) to detect and alert about events (2) count the number of events in a week (3) count events for a specific day
	• Visualization:

			Sun	Mon	Tues	Wed	Thurs	Fri	Sat
		Week1	Volunteer	Delivery			Doctor		Soccer
		Week2		Exam1		Mechanic			Soccer
		Week3	Volunteer	Off Work		Birthday		Concert	
		Week4		Exam2			Doctor		Soccer
		Week5	Visit Family						
	
	• Code:
	
		String[ ][ ] calendar = { { "volunteer", "deliver", null, null, "doctor", null, "soccer" }, 
						{ null, "exam1", null, "mechanic", null, null, "soccer" }, 
						{ "volunteer", "off work", null, "birthday", null, "concert", null" },
						{ null, "exam2", null, null, "doctor", null, "soccer" },
						{ "visit family", null, null, null, null, null, null };
						
		○ Row-major or column-major order can be used to access indiviual evens
		○ Row-major order must be used to count evvent per wee (each row = 1 week)
		○ 1st and 2nd requirements using one set of nested row-major loops
		
		for( int i = 0; i < calendar.length; i++ )
		{
			numberOfEventsPerWeek = 0;
			for( int j = 0; j < calendar[ i ].length; j++)
			{
				//conditional logic to not count empty days
				String event = calendar[ i ][ j ];
				if( event != null && !event.equals(" ") )
				//if day != null or empty string, then print and count
				{
					System.out.println("Week: " + (i + 1) + ", Day: " + (j + 1) + ", Event: " + event);
					numberOfEventsPerWeek++;
				}
			}
			System.out.println( "Total number of events for week: " + (i + 1) + ": " + numberOfEventsPerWeek + "\n" );
		}
		
		○ The 3rd requirement need column-major order
	
		int numberOfEventsPerWeekday = 0;
		//new array so days have names instead of numbers
		String[ ] days = { "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday" };
		for( int i = 0; i < calendar[ 0 ].length; i++)
		{
			numberOfEventsPerWeekday = 0;
			for( int j = 0; j < calendar.length; j++ )
			{
				//rember to flip iterators in the accessor
				//also, remember i = columns and j = rows
				String event = calendar[ j ][ i ];
				if( event != null && !event.equals(" ") )
				//makes sure there's an event counter before counting it
				{
					numberOfEventsPerWeekday++;
				}
			}
			//use days[] to make the index a word
			System.out.println( "Number of events on " + days[ i ] + ": " + numberOfEventsPerWeekday );
		}
		
	• We can use conditional logic to skip areas
		
		if( j != 0 && j! = 6) <- skips Sunday (0) and Saturday (6)
