# Intro

	• We hate repeating ourselves in code
		○ Writing the same code over and over is time consuming
		○ Having less code means having less to debug
	• Often we need to do the same task over and over again
		○ So, we use loops
	• The compiler first evaluates a boolean
		○ If the condition is true, then the loop is executed
		○ Once the last line is executed, the boolean is reevaluated
		○ The process continues until the condition is false
		○ If the condition is initialy false, then the code is never executed
	• We'll go over 3 types of loops
		○ while loops
		○ for loops
		○ for-each loops

# While Loops

	• while loops look similar to if statements
		
		while (silliness > 10){
			//Code to run
		}

		○ if the condition is true, the code block will run
		○ The code runs over and over until the condition evaluates to false
	
		int attempts = 0;
		
		while (passcode != 0524 && attempts < 4) {
			System.out.println("Try again.");
			passcode = getNewPasscode();
			attempts += 1;
		}
		
	• while loops are extremely useful when you want to run code until a specific change happens
		○ Beware of infinite loops!!
	• Infinite loops occur when the condition will never evaluate to false

		int hedgehogs = 5;
		
		while (hedgehogs < 6) {
			System.out.println("Not enough hedgehogs!");
		}

		○ This will cause an infinite amount of output…  which is bad.

# Example: Random Generator

import java.util.Random; <- importing the Random library

class LuckyFive {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Random randomGenerator = new Random(); <- creating a random number generator
		
		int dieRoll = randomGenerator.nextInt(6)+1; <- generate a number between 1 and 6
		
		while (dieRoll != 5) { <- repeat until roll is 5
			System.out.println(dieRoll);
			dieRoll = randomGenerator.nextInt(6)+1;
		}
	}
}

# Incrementing While Loops

	• When looping code, it's common to use a counter variable
		○ A counter (also known as an iterator) is a variable in the conditional logic of the loop and is usually incremented in value during each iteration

		int wishes = 0; <- counter is initialized
		
		while (wishes < 3) { <- conditional logic using the iterator
			System.out.println("Wish granted!");
			wishes++; <- counter is incremented
		}
		
	• We can also decrement counters:

		int pushupsToDo = 10;
		
		while (pushupsToDo > 0) {
			doPushup();
			pushupsToDo--;
		}

# For Loops

	• A for loop is made up of 3 parts
		1. Initializeation of the loop control variable
		2. A boolean statement
		3. An increment or decrement statement

		for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { }
		
		○ An initialize statement is run once to initalize the loop control variable
		○ That variable is modified in every iteration, can be referenced in the loop body, and is used to test the boolean condition
	• Brak down:
		1. i = 0: i is intialized to 0
		2. i < 5: the boolean condition. The loop will continue until i < 5 is false
		3. i++: i will increment at the end of each loop before the boolean is reevaluated
	• for loops help us to remember to increment our counter
		○ Helps prevent infinite loops

# Iterating Over Lists

	• A common pattern is to traverse, or loop, through a list of data and do something with each item
	• To traverse an array or ArrayList, we must access each element via its index
		○ We an use the counter vaiable to trackt eh index of the current element as we iterate over the list of data
	• Since the first index will be 0, the counter begins at 0 and increments to the end of the list

				For arrays
		for (int i = 0; i < secretCode.length; i++) {
			secretCode[i] += 1;
		}
		
				For ArrayLists
		for (int i = 0; I < secretCode.size(); i++) {
			int num = secretCode.get(i);
			secretCode.set(i, num + 1);
		}
		
	• We can also use while loops

				For arrays
		int i = 0;
		while (i < secretCode.length) {
			secretCode[i] += 1;
			i++;
		}
		
				For ArrayLists
		int i = 0;
		while (i < secretCodes.size()) {
			int num = secretCode.get(i);
			secretCode.set(i, num + 1);
			i++;
		}

# `break` and `continue`

	• We can use break and continue to exit a loop early, or to skip one of the iterations
	• break is used to exit (or break) a loop

		for (int i= 0; i < 10; i++) {
			System.out.println(i);
			if (i == 4) {
				break;
			}
		}
		
		○ Even though the loop is set to run until i < 10, the loop will stop at 4
	• The continue keyword allows us to skip an iteration
		○ If continue is used, the current loop ends and the next will begin

		int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
		
		for (int i = 0, i < numbers.length; i++) {
			if (numbers[i] % 2 == 0) {
				continue;
			}
		}
		
		○ This loop will skip all even numbers

# AP Concept

	• If the return keyword is executed inside a loop contained in a method, the loop iteration would be stopped and the method would be exited

		public static boolean checkForJacket(String[] 1st) {
			for (int i = 0; i < 1st.length; i++) {
				System.out.println(1st[i]);
				if (1st[i] == "jacket") {
					return true;
				}
			}
			return false;
		}
		
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			String[] suitcase = {"shirt", "jacket", "pants", "socks"};
			System.out.println(checkForJacket(suitcase));
		}
		
		○ As soon as an element equals "jacket", return true; is executed
			§ This causes the loop to stop and the compiler to exit checkForJacket()

# For-each Loops

	• For-each loops, also known as enhanced loops, allow us to directly loop through each item in a list and perform some action with each item

		for (String element : array) {
			System.out.println(element)
		}
		
		○ We have 2 items
			§ An enhanced for loop variable (element)
			§ A list to traverse (array)
		○ We can read (:) as "in"
			§ For each element in array print element
	• If we assign a new value to the enhanced loop, the loop variable is assigned a copy of the list element

# Removing Elements During Traversal

	• You can easily run into an error if you aren't careful when doing this
	• When an element is removed from an ArrayList, all the items after the removed element have their index value shifted by -1

			Removing an Element Using while
	• When using a while loop and removing elements form an ArrayList, we should not increment the while loop's counter whenever we remove an element
		○ If we remove the elment at index 3, then what was at 4 will be moved to 3
		○ If we increase the counter, the we will skip the element that moved

		int i = 0; <- initialize the counter
		
		while (i < lst.size()) {
			if (lst.get(i) % 2 !=2 0) { <- if value is odd, remove value
				lst.remove(i);
			} else {
				i++; <- if value is even, increment counter
			}
		}
		
			Removing an Element Using for
	• When using a for loop, we must increase the control variable no matter what due to the arguments for a for loop
		○ Since we can't avoid it, we need to decrease the counter when we remove an element

		for (int i = 0; i < lst.size(); i++) {
			if (lst.get(i) == "value to remove"){
				lst.remove(lst.get(i));
				i--;
			}
		}
	• Avoid manipulating the size of an ArrayList when using a for-each loop
It could cause a ConcurrentModificationException error
