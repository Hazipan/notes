# Intro

	• Conditional and control flow statements allow our code to make decisions
		○ Before now, our code has gone only line-by-line, top-down
		○ Conditional Statements allow us to be selective in which portions of our code run
	• Conditional statements check a boolean condition and run a block of code depending on the condition
		○ Curly bracers are used to estabish the scope of a conditional block, just like a method or class
			
			if (condition statement) {
				System.out.println("Hello World");
			}
			
		○ If the condition is true, then the block runs.
If it's false, then it doesn't run

# If-Then

	• If-then statements are the simplest control flow we can use
		○ It tests an expression for truth and executes code based on it

		if (flip == 1) {
			System.out.println("Heads");
		}
		
		○ if marks the beginning of a conditional statement, followed by ()
		○ The () holds a boolean datatype
	• We can also use variables in the parentheses if they reference a boolean or comparison that evaluates into a boolean
		○ The block runs if, and only if, the boolean is true
			
			int numItemsInCart = 9;
			
			if (numItemsInCart > 12) {
				System.out.println("Express checkout not available");
			}
			
	• If the conditional is brief, you can omit the curly bracers

			if (conditional) System.out.println("Hello World");

# If-Then-Else

	• If-then-else can be used if you want 2 possible blocks of code
		
		if (hasPrerequisites) {
			//enroll in course
		} else {
			//do not enroll in course
		}
	• This ensures that exactly one block of code will be run
		○ If the condition is false, then the code block after else runs

# If-Then-Else-Then

	• You can chain together as many conditionals as you need

		String course = "Theatre";
		
		if (course.equals("Biology")) {
			//enroll in Biology
		} else if (course.equals("Algebra")) {
			//enroll in Algebra
		} else if (course.equals("Theatre")) {
			//enroll in Theatre
		} else {
			System.out.println("Course not found!");
		}

# Nested Conditionals

	• Complex conditional structures can be built through nested conditional statements
		○ Placing conditional statements inside other conditional statements

		if (outer condition) {
			if (nested condition) {
				Instructions if both conditions are ture
			}
		}
		
		int temp = 45
		boolean raining = true
		
		if (temp < 60) {
			System.out.println("Wear a jacket!");
			if (raining == true) {
				System.out.println("Bring an umbrella!");
			} else {
				System.out.println("Leave your umbrella home");
			}
		}

# Switch Statements

	• Instead of chaining if-then-else conditions, you can use a switch statement
		○ It will check a value against any number of conditions and run the code where there is a match

		String course = "History";
		
		switch (course) {
			case "Algebra": <- note the colon. Not a semi-colon
				//enroll in Algebra
			break; <- use break; to exit the switch statement
			case "Biology":
				//enroll in Biology
			break;
			case "History":
				//enroll in History
			break;
			default:
				//course not found
		}
		
		○ Without all code after the case is run, even if it's in another case
