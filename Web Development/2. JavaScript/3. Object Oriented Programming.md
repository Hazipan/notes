	• The this keyword will access the current object
		○ So if we had a dog object with a name property and we were writing a function that involves the dog's name, the best way to access that would be to use the this keyword
		○ this.name;
		○ That way if the name of the object changes, calling the property will still work.
	• We can create constructor functions that build objects
		○ The name of the function should be capitalized to distiguish it from other functions
		○ When defining the default properties, you use the this keyword
		
		function Dog() {
			this.name = "Fido";
			this.color = "Brown";
			this.numLegs = 4;
		}
		
	• To construct a new object using the constructor, we declare an object and assign it as a new object of the constructor
		
		let myDog = new Dog();
		
		○ From here we can manipulate the properties of myDog
	• To make a blank object that we assign property values to at creation, we can create arguments in the constructor parameters
		○ We can also make it so that specific properties are guarunteed to have a certain value, if that value would be the same across all new objects of that type
		
		function Dog(name, color) {
			this.name = name;
			this.color = color;
			this.numLegs = 4;
		}
		
	• We can verify that if a variable is an object by using the instanceof keyword
		
		myDog instanceof Dog;
		// returns true it was created with the Dog constructor
		// returns false if it wasn't created with the Dog constructor
		
	• The properties declared in a constructor are called own properties because they are defined directly on the instance object.
		○ That means that each instance of the object has its own separate copy of these properties
		○ We can add all the own properties of an object to an array by iterating through the objects properties
		
		let ownProps = [];
		
		for (let property in myDog) {
			if(myDog.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
				ownProps.push(property);
			}
		}
		
		console.log(ownProps);
		// prints ["name", 'color", "numLegs"];
		
	• Properties that would remain the same throughout all instances can be a problem if each object has a copy of that property and there are millions of those objects
		○ We can cut down on the amount of code by using prototype
		○ Any property assigned to the prototype of an object is shared among all instances of that object
		
		Dog.prototype.numLegs = 4;
		// makes all instances of Dog have numLegs = 4
		
		○ This is added outside of the constructor
	• When iterating through own properties, prototype properties will not show up
		○ We can iterate through properties and separate out own properties and prototype properties through this code block:
		
		let ownProps = [];
		let prototypeProps = [];
		
		for (let property in myDog) {
			if(myDog.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
				ownProps.push(property);
			} else {
				prototypeProps.push(property);
			}
		}
		
	• We can use the .constuctor property to help see what constructor created the object
		
		myDog.constructor === Dog;
		// returns true
		
	• Adding prototype properties can be tedious
		○ However, we can add all out prototype properties all at once by setting the prototype to a new object that contains those properties already
		
		Dog.prototype = {
			numLeg: 4,
			eat: function() {
				console.log("nom nom nom");
			},
			speack: function() {
				console.log("Woof Woof!");
			}
		};
		
	• When manually setting prototype properties like this, it will erase the constructor property which can mean we get incorrect results when using the .constructor property
		○ To avoid this from being a problem, set the constructor property in the prototype
		
		Dog.prototype = {
			constructor: Dog,
			numLeg: 4,
			eat: function() {
				console.log("nom nom nom");
			},
			speack: function() {
				console.log("Woof Woof!");
			}
		};
		
	• You can check to see if an Object has a prototype relation to a constructor by using the isPrototypeOf() funciton
		
		Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(myDog);
		// returns true
		
	• All objects in JavaScript (with some exception) have a prototype, and the prototype itself is an object that can be manipulated
		○ This means that prototypes can have prototypes, creating prototype chains
		○ This is useful because it allows us to use functions lik hasOwnProperty()
		○ That function is part of Object, which is the supertype of all other objects
		○ Any function and properties it has, is inherited by all other objects because they are subtypes
		
		
		Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Dog.prototype);
		// returns true
		
	• Use inheritance so you don't repeat yourself
		○ If all object of multiple types would have the same property, create a supertype object
		○ Example: both Dog and Cat object might have the same eat property. We can then declare an Animal object that give properties to both dogs and cats
		
		function Animal() {}
		Animal.prototype.eat = function() {
			console.log("nom nom nom");
		};
		
	• To let an object inherit the properties of the supertype, you must create it as a prototype of the supertype's prototype using the Object.creaet() function
		
		let myDog = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
		
		○ Object.create(obj) creates a new object and sets obj as the new object's prototype
		○ So here we are giving the prototype of animal to myDog
			§ It inherits the prototype properties of Animal
		○ However, this only set one Dog (myDog) to inherit from Animal
	• To set all types of an object to inherit from another, you set the prototype to inherit
		
		Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
		// All Dog objects inherit form Animal now
		
	• When an object inherits from another object, it also inherits the constructor property, and you'll need to reset it
		
		Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;
		myDog.constructor;
		// returns Dog instead of Animal
		
	• Objects that inherit can still have their own unique properties in their prototype, bimply by adding new ones
	
		Dog.prototype.tailWag = funciton() {
			console.log("wag wag");
		};
		
	• You can override inherited methods by simply reassigning it
	
		Dog.prototype.eat = function() {
			return "munch, munch, munch";
		};
		
	• When you want to two object types to inherit a property, but they're too different to warent full inheritence (like birds and planes, both can fly but only one is an animal) we can use a Mixin function
		
		let flyMixin = function(obj) {
			obj.fly = function() {
				console.log("Flying, woooosh!");
			}
		};
		
		○ Now we can set any object that can fly to have the fly property without having each one inherit from the same object
		○ Usefule for when objects would share very little in common
	• When creating object properties that shouldn't be able to be changed by external code, be sure to declare the variable within the scope of the object and only the object
		○ That means setting it in the constructor so that external code wouldn't affect it
		○ That means not using the this keyword, but using let or const
		
		function Bird() {
			let numLegs = 2;
			
			this.getLegCount = funciton() {
				return numLegs;
			}
		}
		/* This makes it so that numLegs is local only to the bird object and cannot be changed, only view, from external code */
		
	• IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expression
		○ This is a common pattern where a function is executed as soon as it's declared
		
		(funciton () {
			console.log("Chirp, chirp!");
		})();
		
		○ The above is an IIFE
		○ It's an anonymous function that gets executed immediately
		○ Useful fo when you want something to happen once an never again
			§ Like something happens when you create an object, but you can't make it happen again without creating another object
	• IIFE can be used to create modules
	
		let motionModule = (function () {
		  return {
		    glideMixin: function(obj) {
		      obj.glide = function() {
		        console.log("Gliding on the water");
		      };
		    },
		    flyMixin: function(obj) {
		      obj.fly = function() {
		        console.log("Flying, wooosh!");
		      };
		    }
		  }
		})();
		
		○ This bundles 2 Mixin functions into a module called motionModule
		○ This store the functions in an object as properties
		○ Packs it into a single object that can be used by other parts of code
		
		// Example
		motionModule.glideMxin(duck);
		duck.glide();
