# Commenting out and Printing to the Console

Commenting out:

- `//` for one-line comments
- `/* [text] */` for multi-line comments

Printing to the console:

```JS
console.log( [Variable or String] );
```

# Variable Types

JavaScript has 8 data types

1. `undefined`
2. `null`
3. `boolean`
4. `string`
5. `symbol`
6. `bigint`
7. `number`
8. `object`

# Declaration and Assignment

To declare a variable, the sytax is:
		
```JS
var myVariable;
```

A variable name can be made up of numbers, letters, and `$` and `_` symbols. They cannot have spaces or begin with a number.

You assign the value of a variable by setting it equal to something. Once assigned a value, the data type is automatically interpreted based on the value.

```JS
myVariable = 5;
```
		
You can, of course, assign value at declaration.
		
```JS
var myVariable = 5;
```

When a variable is declared, but not assigned a value, it's initial value will be `undefined`. If you try to do mathermatical computation with an `undefined` value, the result is `NaN` (Not a Number).

If you concatenate a `string` ("String" + "String") with an `undefined` variable, the word undefined will contcatenate with the `string`.

When naming variables, it is best pactrice to use camelCase, and remember that variable names are case sensitive.

When declaring variables in long blocks of code, it can be easy to accidentally overwrite a variable by redeclaring it. Using the `let` keyword instead of `var` allows you to declare the variable only once, preventing the override of future declarations
		
```JS
var name = "James";
var name = "David";
// results in name being equal to "David" in the end
		
let name = "James";
let name = "David";
// results in an error since name was declared twice
```

Using `var` also make the variable available globally, meaning that if the variable is declared inside a function, it can be used outside of the function. `let` only declares the variable locally.
		
Another way to declare a variable is to make it constant by using the `const` keyword. When declared with `const`, the variable becomes read-only. Whatever value it is assigned initially is what the value always will be, it cannot be changed. Naming conventions for these variables is ALL_CAPS with underscores between words.
		
```JS
const FAV_COLOR = "Green";
```
		
# Mathematical Operators
You can use mathematical operators to math with numbers. Operators available: 

- `+`
- `-`
- `*`
- `/`
- `%` - the modulo operator. It returns the remainder when dividing the two numbers

You can increment nubmers by using `++` or `--`.

```JS
let myNum = 5;
myNum++; // myNum == 6 now
```

You can perform a mathematical opertaion that changes the value of the variable by using `[mathSymbol]=`
	
```JS
let myVar = 5;
myVar += 5; // myVar == 10 now
```
		
# Escape Codes
Use the escape code `\"` to place double quotes inside a string.
		
```JS
let myVar = "I am a \"String\"."; // myVar == I am a "String".
```
		
You can also surround your string in single quotes (`'`), this way you do not need to use an escape code when insterting quotations. However, if anything has an apostraphe, that will need the escape character `\'`.

All the different escape codes:
- `\'` - single quote
- `\"` - double quote
- `\\` - backslash
- `\n` - newline
- `\r` - carriage return
- `\t` - tab
- `\b` - word boundary
- `\f` - form feed

# Strings
You can concatenate (join together or combine) Strings by using the plus operator (`+`).
		
```Js
let string1 = "Hello ";
let string2 = "World!";
let string3 = string1 + string2; // holds "Hello World!"
```
		
You can also use the `+=` operator on strings

```JS
let string1 = "Hello";
let string1 += " World!" // holds "Hello World!"
```

You can return the character length of a string by using `.length`.
		
```JS
let str = "Hello";
let strLength = string.length; // holds 5
```

You can return a specific character of a string by using bracket notation. The number inside the bracket determines which character is returned. The first letter of a string is at index 0, `String[0]` would return the first letter and `String[3]` would retrun the fourth letter.
		
```JS
let str = "Hello";
let secondLetter = str[1]; // holds "e"
```

You cannot alter a string value by attempting to reassign an index.

```JS
let str = "Hello";
str[1] = "o"; // Error
```

An easy way to find the last letter of a string is to access `String.length - 1`. Using this, you can find a letter starting from the back rather than the front by adjusting the 1 to move further away from the last letter.
		
```JS
var str = "Hello";
var lastLetter = str[str.length - 1];
```
		

Strings are immutable, and therefore can only be changed if you reassign the variable. But there are methods you can use to modify the string and return a new one (meaning you would need to assign the `String.method()` to a new variable).

- You can change the case type of a string by using `.toLowerCase()` and `.toUpperCase()`
- You can use the `.split()` .
- The `.slice()` method extracs specific section of a string.
- The `.join()` method joins all elements of an array into a string
- The `.charAt()` method returns the specific character from a string
	
# Arrays
Arrays are a set of values stored in one value.
	
```JS
const sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"];
```
		
The data types do not have to be the same, meaning you can have a combination of numbers, Strings, characters, etc. You can also nest arrays within arrays to create multi-dimensional arrays.
		
```JS
const teams = [ ["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 34] ];
```
		
You can return the value inside an array by calling its index number. Indeces begin a 0.
		
```JS
const sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"];
var ingredient = sandwich[1]; // holds "jelly"
```
		
Accessing multidimensional arrays is the same, just with added brackets. First bracket starts on the outermost layer and they work their way in.
		
```JS
const teams = [ ["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 34] ];
var favTeam = teams[1][0]; // holds "White Sox"
```
		
If you were to only do `teams[1]` it would set `favTeam` to `["White Sox, 34] ` instead of just `"White Sox"`

# Manipulating Arrays
Arrays are mutable, which means they can be changed freely, even if declard as a `const`. To change a specific index, we use braket notation.
		
```JS
const sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"];
sandwich[1] = "jam";
// sandwich now holds ["peanut butter", "jam", "bread"]
```
		
	• You can use the .push() function to push data to the end on an array
		○ It can take multiple arguments
		
		const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
		arr1.push(4);
		// arr1 is now [1, 2, 3, 4]
		
		const arr2 = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
		arr2.push(["happy", "joy"]);
		// arr2 is now ["Stimpson", "J", "cat", ["happy", "joy"]]
		
	• .pop() will remove the last element of an array and store it in a variable
		
		const threeArr = [1, 4, 6];
		const oneDown = threeArr.pop();
		// threeArr is now [1, 4]
		// oneDown is equal to 6
		
	• .shift() works the same way as .pop() but removes and stores the first element instead
	• .unshift() works the same as .push(), but pushes the data to the beginning of the array
		○ You could use .shift() then .unshift() in succesion to move an element from the end of an array to the beginning
		○ Or to remove something from the end and add something new to the beginning
	• For these functions, you don't have to store the data in a new variable. If you choose not to, the element is simply removed and not stored anywhere

Functions
	• You can create functions that perform specific tasks
		○ This allows us to create reusable code
		○ To create a function, you use the keyword, function. Then you set the function name followed by ([parameters]). Then you have a set of curly bracers ({}), and the code within the curly bracers is what's run when the function is called.
		
		function myFunction() {
			console.log("Hello World");
		}
		
		myFunction();
		// prints "Hello World" to the console
		
	• You can create parameters that affect the output of the code
		
		function myFunction( param1, param2 ) {
			console.log( param1, param2 );
		}
		
		myFunction( "Hello ", "World!");
		// prints "Hello World!" to the console
		
	• Using the return statement at the end of a function will cause the funciton output to come back and be stored
		
		function plusThree( num ) {
			return num + 3;
		}
		
		const answer = plusThree(5);
		// answer is equal to 8;

	• If you need a variable to come back from a function, be sure to have a return statement, otherwise the funciton will produce an undefined variable

Scope
	• Variables declared outside of a function block have a global scope, meaning they can be seen everywhere in your code
		○ If declared inside a function block, then the function can only be seen (used) within that function block
	• Variables declared without let or const will always be global, so be sure to use let or const when declaring variables
	• The most local variable will always take precident if a local variable has the same name as a more global variable

Queues
	• Queues are abstract data structures that keep items in order
	• We can create queus with arrays and using .push() and .shift()
	
		/* function that adds an item to the end and removes an item from the beginning of a queue */
		fuction nextInLine( arr, item ) {
			arr.push( item );
			item = arr.shift();
			
			return item;
		}

Booleans and Conditionals
	• Booleans can have one of two values
		○ true or false
	• If statements are created with the if keyword
		
		if ( [condition] ) {
			[code to be executed if condition is met]
		}
		
	• There are comparison operators to help build condition statements
		○ == checks if the values on each side are the same (equal to)
		○ When comparing two different data types, it will attempt to coerce one type to become the other
			§ 1 == 1 // true
			§ 1 == 2 // false
			§ 1 == '1' // true
			§ 1 == "1" // true
		○ === checks for strict equality
			§ data types must be the same
		○ != checks if the values on each side are different (not equal to)
		○ !== check for strict inequality
			§ data types will not be converted
		○ > - greater than
		○ >= - greater than or equal to
		○ < - less than
		○ <= - less than or equal to
	• Logical operators are used to put multiple conditions together in one condition statement
		○ && - AND
			§ The left and right conditions must be met
		○ || - OR
			§ The left or right condition must be met
	• You can use the else keyword in conjunction with if to make if-else functions
		
		if ( val < 5 ) {
			return "Is less than 5";
		} else {
			return "Is 5 or greater";
		}
		
	• You can create else-if statements by chaining multiple if-else functions
		
		if ( val < 5 ) {
			return "Less than 5";
		} else if ( val == 5 ) {
			reurun "Equal to 5";
		} else {
			return "Greater than 5";
		}
		
		○ You can chain as many together as you want to create complex logic sequences
	• Sometimes people use an if/else statement to do a comparison, like this:
	
		function isEqual(a, b) {
			if (a === b) {
				return true;
			} else {
				return false;
			}
		}
	
		○ But there's a better way to do this. Since === returns true or false, we can return the result of the comparison:
	
		function isEqual(a, b) {
			return a === b;
		}
	
	• You can create 1-line if-else statements with a ? b : c
		○ a is the condition
		○ b is the code if the condition is true
		○ c is the code if the condition is false
		
		function findGreater(a, b) {
			return a > b ? "a is greater" : "b is greater or equal";
		}
	• You can stack these, just like regular if-else statements
		
		function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
			return (a === b) ? "a and b are equal" 
				: (a > b) ? "a is greater" 
				: "b is greater";
		}
		
Switch Statements
	• You can use switch statements instead of if-else statements if you have a lot of possible options in you conditional logic
		
		switch(lowercaseLetter) {
			case "a":
				console.log("A");
				break;
			case "b":
				console.log("B");
				break;
		}
		
		○ Case statements use strict equallity
		○ In a switch statement, you can define a default statement that will catch any options you didn’t account for
		
		defualt: 
			[defaul statement]
			break;
		
	• If you omit the break statement, it will execute all following case statements until a break statement is encountered

		let result = "";
		switch(val) {
			case 1:
			case 2:
			case 3:
				result = "1, 2, or 3";
				break;
			case 4:
				result = "4 alone";
		}
		
	• If you have if-else statements that use nothing but strict equality, then it's a good idea to replace it with a switch statement instead

Objects
	• creating objects in JavaScript is a bit different than in Java
		○  See the Java notebook for a good explanation on what objects are 
		○ Syntax to create objects and give them properties:
		
		const dog = {
			name = "Fido",
			color = "Brown"
			"Number of Friends": 73;
		};
		
		○ note that the properties have commas inbetween and there are no semi-colons until the end of the object scope
		○ If the name of a property has spaces, it must have double quotes around it
			§ You could also use camelCase instead
			§ Or underscore_case
	• To access object properties, you use dot notation
	
		let myDogsColor = dog.color;
		
	• A second way to access properties is through bracket notation
		○ If the property had spaces in the name, you must do it this way
		○ Best to always do it this way. Keeps from creating issues when accessing properties through functions
		
		let myDogsColor = dog[color];
		
	• You can reassign properties by calling the property, then setting it equal to a value
	
		dog.color = "White";
		
	• You can add properties by calling a property that doesn't exist and giving it a value
	
		dog["Favorite Treat"] = "Jerky";
		
		
	• You can delete properties with the delete keyword
		
		delete dog.name;
		
	• Objects can be thought of as a key/value storage, like a dictionary. If you have tabular data, you can use an object to lookup values rather than a switch statement or an if/else chain.
		○ This is most useful when you know that your input data is limited to a certain range.
	• If you ever need to test to see if an object has a property, use .hasOwnProperty(propName)
	
		dog.hasOwnProperty("name");
		
	• You can create complex objects by having arrays inside objects, or creating an array of objects with nested metadata
		
		const myMusic = [
			{
				"artist": "Billy Joel",
				"title": "Piano Man",
				"release_year": 1973,
				"formats": [
					"CD",
					"8T",
					"LP"
				],
				"gold": true
			}, {
				"artist": "Marjorstua Kammerkor & Tore Erik Mohn",
				"title": "Ola Gjeilo: Sunrise Mass",
				"release_year": 2013,
				"formats": [
					"Spotify",
					"CD"
				]
			}
		];
		
	• You can created sub-properties and access them by chaining dot or bracket notation
	
		const ourStorage = {
			"desk": {
				"drawer": "stapler"
			},
			"cabinet": {
				"top drawer": {
					"folder1": "a file",
					"folder2": "secrets"
				},
				"botom drawer": "soda"
			}
		};
		
		ourStorage.cabinet["top drawer"].folder2; // accesses "secrets"
		ourStorage.desk.drawer; // accesses "stapler"
		
	• You can access arrays inside objects by simply calling the property and the desired index
		
		ourPets[0].names[1];
		ourPets[1].names[0];
		
Loops
	• While loops
		
		const ourArray = [];
		let i = 0;
		
		while (i < 5) {
			ourArray.push(i);
			i++;
		}
		
		○ Make sure to set up an iterator (in this case, the variable i) to avoid creating infinite loops
	• For loops
		
		const ourArray = [];
		
		for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
		  ourArray.push(i);
		}
		
		○ This lets us put the initial value and the incrementor inside the loop condition
	• You don't have to increment by one, you increment in anyway you want to create custom loops
	• Iterating through an array with For loops
		
		const arr = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6];
		
		for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
			console.log(arr[i]);
		}

	• Iterating through multi-dimensional arrays
		
		const arr = [
			[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]
		];
		
		for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
			for (let j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
				console.log(arr[i][j]);
			}
		}
		
	• Do…While loop
		○ These allow the code to run before the condition is checked.
		
		const ourArray = [];
		let i = 0;
		
		do {
			ourArray.push(i);
			i++;
		} while (i < 5);
		
Recursion
	• Recursion is the concept where you create a function that callls itself instead of using loops
		○ Example: a function that returns the sum of the first n elements of an array arr
		
		function sum(arr, n) {
			if (n <= 0) {
				return 0;
			} else {
				return sum(arr, n - 1) + arr[n - 1];
			}
		}
		
Math.random()
	• Math.random(), when used as is, generates a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exlusive)
	• To make it generate a random whole number, multiply the randomly generated number, then use Math.floor() to round the number down to the nearest whole number
		
		Math.floor(Math.random() * 20);
		
		○ This will give us a random whole number between 0 and 19
		○ Change the top of the range by multiplying Math.random() by different values
	• To fully define a range, use the following formula
		
		Math.floor( Math.random() * ( [max] - [min] + 1 ) ) + [min];
		
	• parseInt() parses a string and return an interger
	
		const a = parseInt( "007" );
		// a is equal to 7
		
parseInt( string, radix )
	• You can use a second argument in parseInt()
		○ This second argument is the radix and must be an interger between 2 and 36
		○ This defines the base number system to parse to
			§ 2 would be binary
		
		const a = parseInt( "11", 2 );
		// a is equal to 3
