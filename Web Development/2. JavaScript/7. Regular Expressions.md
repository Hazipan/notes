The Test Method
	• Regular expresseion (often shortened to regex or regexp)  help us match, search, and replace text (strings).
	• If you wanted to find the word "the" in the string "The dog chased the cat", you could use the regular expression /The/
	• One way to test a regex is to use the .test() method
		○ The .test() method takes the regex, applies it to a string that is placed in the parentheses, and returns true or false
		
		let testStr = "freeCodeCamp";
		let testRegex = /Code/;
		testRegex.test(testStr);
		// returns true
		
	• The test method searches for string literals, that means that it has to match exactly
		○ The will only match The, but not the or THE
	• You can test for different possibilities by using the OR operator (|)
		
		let testRegex = /yes|no|maybe/
		
	• You can let the regex ignore case types by using the flag i
		○ Flags are set after the end slash
		○ There are other flags, too
		○ i stands for insensitive
		
		let testRegex = /the/i;
		
Extracting Matches
	• You can take a found match and extract it out with the .match() method
	
		let ourStr = "Regular expressions";
		let ourRegex = /expressions/;
		ourStr.match(ourRegex);
		// returns ["expressions"]
	
		○ Note that the sytax is "opposite" from the .test() method
	• Normally this would only return the frist match
		○ If we want to return all matches, we can add the flag g at the end of the regex
		○ g stands for global
		
		let testStr = "Repeat, Repeat, Repeat";
		let ourRegex = /Repeat/g;
		testStr.match(outRegex);
		// returns ["Repeat", "Repeat", "Repeat"]

	• You can use capture groups to search then replace by using .replace()
		
		let wrongText = "The sky is silver.";
		let silverRegex = /silver/;
		wrongText.replace(silverRegex, "blue");
		// changes wrongText to "The sky is blue"
		
		○ You can also access capture groups in the replacement string with the dollar sign ($)
		
		"Code Camp".replace(/(\w+)\s(\w+)/, '$2 $1');
		// returns Camp Code

Regex Manipulations
	• You can match anything with a wildcard character (.)
		
		let humStr = "I'll hum a song";
		let hugStr = "Bear hug";
		let huRegex = /hu./;
		huRegex.test(humStr);
		huRegex.test(hugStr);
		// both returns true
		
	• You can match multiple possibilities by defining options inside brackets
	
		let bgRegex = /b[aiu]g/ig;
		// matches bag, big, and bug
		
	• You can match with a range of letters
	
		let bgRegex = /[a-e]at/ig;
		// Matches aat through eat
		
	• You can also do a range of number
		○ You can also do it side by side with letters
		
		let myRegex = /[a-z0-9]/ig;
		
	• You can negate character sets by by using the caret character (^)
		
		let myRegex /[^aeiou]/gi;
		// matches all characters that aren't vowls
		
	• Sometimes you need to match a character (or group of character) that appear one or more times in a row
		○ We can use the + character to check for that
		○ Remember, the character or pattern has to be consecutive
		○ Take /a+/g
		○ In abc it would find one match and return ["a"]
		○ In aabc it would find one match and return ["aa"]
		○ In abac it would find two matches and return ["a", "a"]
		○ In bcd it would find no matches
	• We can find matches that occur zero or more times by using the astrisk (*)
		
		let soccerWord = "gooooooooal!";
		let gPhrase = "gut feeling";
		let oPhrase = "over the moon";
		let goRegex = /go*/;
		soccorWord.match(goRegex);
		// returns ["goooooooo"]
		gPhrase.match(goRegex);
		// returns ["g"]
		oPhrase.match(goRegex);
		// returns null
		
	• Normally these expressions are greedy meaning they'll return the longest possible string they can find
		○ We can make lazy matches by using the question mark (?)
		
		let myWord = "titanic";
		greedyRegex = /t[a-z]*i/;
		/* meaing begin with t, end with i, and letters
		inbetween */
		lazyRegex = /t[a-z]*?i/
		
		myWord.match(greedyRegex);
		// returns ["titani"]
		myWord.match(lazyRegex);
		// returns ["ti"]
		
	• We can search for patterns that only appear at the beginning of the string by using the caret character (^)
		○ When used inside a character set, it negates characters from the search
		○ When used outside a character set, it searches the beginning of the string
		
		let firstString = "Ricky is first and can be found.";
		let firstRegex = /^Ricky/;
		firstRegex.test(firstString);
		// returns true
		let notFirst = "You can't find Ricky now.";
		firstRegex.test(notFirst);
		// returns false
		
	• To do the same thing, but for the end of a string, we use an anchor character ($)
		
		let theEnding = "This is a never ending story";
		let storyRegex = /story$/;
		storyRegex.test(theEnding);
		// returns true
		let noEnding = "Sometimes a story will have to end";
		storyRegex.test(noEnding);
		// returns end
		
	• You can specify an upper and lower number of matches by using brackets
		○ /a{3, 5}h/ would match aaah, aaaah, and aaaaah
		○ You can also specify just the lower matches with no upper limit
			§ /a{3,}h/
		○ You can leave out the comma and that matches it with the exact number
			§ /a{3}h/ only matches aaah
	• You can specifiy the possible existence of something using ?
		
		let american = "color";
		let british = "colour";
		let rainbowRegex= /colou?r/;
		rainbowRegex.test(american);
		rainbowRegex.test(british);
		// both return true
		
	• You can check for character group option using parentheses ()
		
		let testStr = "Pumpkin";
		let testRegex = /P(engu|umpk)in/;
		testRegex.test(testStr);
		// will return true for "Penguin" or "Pumpkin"
		
	• You can create capture groups to find a repeating substing
		○ You make one by enclosing the regex pattern to be captured in parentheses
		○ The substring matched by the group is stored in a temporary varible
		○ We call the variable by doing \[capture group number]
			§ Number is automatically assigned left to right starting with 1
		
		let repeatStr = "row row row your boat";
		let repeatRegex = /(\w+) \1 \1/;
		repeatRegex.text(repeatStr);
		// returns true
		repeatStr.match(repeatRegex);
		// returns ["row row row", "row"]
		
		○ When using the .match() method, it will return an array with the matched substring along with its captured groups

Shorthand Character Classes
	• You can match all letters of the alphabet by using /[a-z]/, but it's done so often that there's a shortcut
		○ /\w/ is the equivalent of [A-Za-z0-9_]
		○ This is a shortcut character class, also known as a shorthand character class
	• You can do the opposite of \w by using \W
		○ Same as [^A-Za-z0-9_]
	• The shortcut for number ([0-9]) is \d
		○ Stands for digits
	• To match all non-number use \D
	• To match whitespaces, use \s
		○ This returns all whitespaces, like tabs, carriage returns, form feed, and new line characters
	• To match all non-whitespaces, use \S

Lookaheads
	• Lookaheads are patterns that tell our script to look-ahead to check for patterns further along
		○ Useful for when you want to search for multiple patterns on the same string
	• There are two ckinds of lookaheads, positve and negative
		○ A positive lookahead (?=[pattern]) looks for the pattern but won't match it
		○ A negative lookahead (?![pattern]) will make sure that pattern is not there
			§ The rest of the pattern is returned if the negative lookahead part is not present
		
		let quit = "qu";
		let noquit = "qt";
		let quRegex= /q(?=u)/;
		let qRegex = /q(?!u)/;
		quit.match(quRegex);
		noquit.match(qRegex);
		// both return ["q"]
		
	• A more practical use is to check to or more patterns in one string
		○ To check if a string is between 3 and 6 characters and has at leat one number
		
		let password = "abc123";
		let checkPass = /(?=\w{3,6})(?=\D*\d)/;
		checkPass.test(password);

Cool Example

	1. Usernames can only use alpha-numeric characters.
	2. The only numbers in the username have to be at the end. There can be zero or more of them at the end. Username cannot start with the number.
	3. Username letters can be lowercase and uppercase.
	4. Usernames have to be at least two characters long. A two-character username can only use alphabet letters as characters.
	
	let username = "JackOfAllTrades";
	let userCheck = /^[a-z][a-z]+\d*$|^[a-z]\d\d+$/i;
	let result = userCheck.test(username);
