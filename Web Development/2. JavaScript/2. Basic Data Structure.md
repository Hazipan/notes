# Arrays

The simplest implementation of an array data structure is the one-dimensional array, meaning it has only one level, or no other arrays nested within it. Arrays can hold a set of any combination of variables and data types.

All arrays have a length, which can be recalled by using `[array].length`. 

You can access a specific index of an array by using bracket notation, but remember that the indeces start at 0. Using bracket notation, we can both access and assign indecese

```JS
let ourArray = ["a", "b", "c"];
ourArraay[1] = "d"
// sets the value of "b" to "d"
```

## Manipulating Arrays

We can add items to the array by using `.push()` and `.unshift()`. `.push()` adds an item to the *end* of the array and `.unshift()` adds items to the *beginning* of the array
	
```JS
let ourArray = ["a", "b", "c"];
ourArray.push("e");
ourArray.unshift("z");
// ourArray now contains ["z", "a", "b", "c", "e"]
```
	
We can remove items from the array by using `.pop()` and `.shift()`. `.pop()` removes an item from the end of the array and `.shift()` removes an item from the beginning of the array.
	
```JS
let ourArray = ["a", "b", "c"];
ourArray.pop();
ourArray.shift();
// ourArray now contains ["b"]
```
	
We can also remove items with `.splice()`. This function removes any number of consecutive elements from anywhere in an array. It takes 3 parameters, we will learn two of them:

1. The index to start at.
2. The number of elements to delete from there.
		
```JS
let ourArray = ["a", "b", "c"];
ourArray.splice(1, 2);
// removes "b" and "c" from the ourArray
```
	
Not only does it remove the elements, but it also returns a new array with the removed elements, allowing us to store the removed data in its own variable.

```JS
let ourArray = ["a", "b", "c"];
let littleArray = ourArray.splice(1, 1); // stores ["b"]
// ourArray now holds ["a", "c"]
```
	
You can also add items with `.splice()` (now we'll learn that third parameter). What ever items you pass through the function after the first two parameters will be swapped in place of what was removed.
	
```JS
let ourArray = ["a", "b", "c"];
ourArray.splice(1, 1, 'b', 'c', 'd');
// ourArray now holds ["a", "b", "c", "d", "c"]
```
	
You can copy array items using `.slice()`. It takes two arguments:

1. The index to start on and the second is.
2. the index to stop on
		§ The copying does not include the last element, so make sure to do +1 to the last number
	
```JS
let ourArray = ["a", "b", "c"];
let myArray = ourArray.slice(1, 2); // holds ['b', 'c']
// ourArray stays the same
```

# PICK UP HERE!!
	
• You can copy an entire array by using the spread opertor (…)
	
	let newArray = […ourArray];
	// newArray and ourArray are exactly the same

• Tou can combine arrays with the spread operator
	
	ourArray = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', …newArray];
	// ourArray now holds ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
	
• You can check for the presence of an element using .indexOf()
	○ It either returns the index number or -1, which means that it isn't in the array
	
	ourArray.indexOf('z');
	// returns -1, meaing it's not there
	
• You can iterate through arrays using for loops
	○ See the Basic JavaScript page
• You can create complex multi-dimensional arrays
	○ see the Basic JavaScript page 
```

Objects
• Objects are, at their most basic, a collection of key-value pairs
○ Pieces of data (values) mapped to unique identifiers called properties (keys)
○ You can add properties (keys) to objects using bracket or dot notation
§ See the Basic JavaScript page
• You can nest objects within objects
○ Example: a desk object could contain various drawer objects, and each drawer object could contain various properties outline the contents of the drawer
• Delete object properties with the delete keyword
○ see the Basic JavaScript page
• You can check to see if an item has a specific property by using the .hasOwnProperty() function
○ see the Basic JavaScript page
○ You can also use the in keyword instead

```
 user.hasOwnProperty('Alan');
	// or
	'Alan' in users;

• We can iterate through the keys of objects by using for…in statements
	
	for (let user in users) {
		console.log(user);
	}
	
	○ Value are not stored in objects in a specific order, so they may not be iterated through in the order expected
	○ Use bracket notation when trying to access a property via a variable rather than through the explicit name of the property, or when the property has a space in the name
• You can generate an array of an objects keys using Object.keys([obj]);
