	• The var keyword cuases variables to be declared locally (which can cause issues when you declare variables inside and outside functions
	• The let keyword causes variables to be declared locally, which is preferable
	• The const keyword causes variables to no longer be able to be reassigned
		○ Many develepoers only use const unless they know that they'll need to reassign the variable later, then they use let
		○ When using const, you can still mutate arrays by reassigning specifc indecese
		○ You use Object.freeze() to prevent data mutation
		
		let obj = {
			name: "FreeCodeCamp",
			review: "Awesome"
		};
		
		Object.freeze(obj);
		
Flexible Function Tools
	• When you create a function that will only be used once, you don't need to name it.
		○ Instead you can use Arrow Function to write concise anonymous function
		
		const myFunc = () => {
			const myVar = "value";
			return myVar;
		}
		
	• When you are only returnin a value and using arrow function syntax, you can omit the keyword return as well as brackets to help simplify smaller function into one-line statements
		
		const myFunc = () => "value";
		
		○ Basically, if your function only does one or two simple things, you can simplify your code with arrow function syntax
	• You can also pass arguments into arrow functions
		
		const doubler = (item) => item * 2;
		double(4);
		// returns 8
		
	• You can use default parameters to create more flexible functions
	
		const greeting = (name = "Anonymous") => "Hello " + name;
		
		console.log(greeting("John"));
		console.log(greetign());
		// prints "Hello John"
		// then "Hello Anonymous"
		
	• Another tool for flexible functions is the rest parameter
		○ This allows us to pass a variable number of arguments that are stored in an array that can be accessed later from inside the function
		
		function howMany(…args) {
			return "You have passed " . args.length + " arguments.";
		}
		
		console.log(howMany(0, 1, 2);
		// prints "You have passed 3 arguments"
		console.log(howMany("string", null, [1, 2, 3], { }));
		// prints "You have passed 4 arguments"
		
		○ This allow us to apply map(), filter(), and reduce() on the parameters array
	• The spread operator (…) returns an unpacked array
		○ This allows us to use functions on arrays that would normally expect data values seperated by commas and not an array
		
		const arr = [6, 89, 3, 45];
		const maximus = Math.max(…arr);
		// maximus holds 89
		
		○ Normally, using this function on an array wouldn't work, but the spread operator (…) returns an unpacked array
			§ It spreads the array
		○ This only works in-place, linke in an argument to a function or in an array literal

Destructuring
	• Destructuring assignment is special syntax that allows us to neatly assign value taken directly from an object
		○ Take this:
		
		const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };
		
		const name = user.name;
		const age = user.age;
		
		○ This assigns the values of user to name and age
		○ However, we can create the equivalent in a much neater way
		
		const { name, age } = user;
		
		○ Here, the name and age variables will be created and assigned the values of their respective values from the user object
			§ Much cleaner :)
	• You can also assign a new variable name when destructuring
		
		const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };
		const { name: userName, age: userAge } = user;
		
		○ This creates the variables userName and userAge and assigns them the appropriate value from the user object
		○ You can read it as "get the value of user.name and assign it to a new variable userName"
	• You can also destructure nested objects
		
		const user = {
			johnDoe: {
				age: 34,
				email: 'johnDoe@freeCodeCamp.com'
			}
		};
		
		○ We can destructure this like so:
		
		const { johnDoe: { age, email }} = user;
		
	• We can use destructuring on arrays too
		○ A key difference between the spread operator and array destructuring (,,,) is that the spread operator unpack all contents of an array into a comma seperated list, but destructuring allows us to pick out exactly what gets unpacked
		
		const [a, b] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
		console.log(a, b)
		// console will display 12
		
		○ We can also access values at any index by using commas to reach the desired index
		
		const [a, b,,, c] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
		console.log(a, b, c);
		// the console will display 1, 2, 5
		
		○ We're creating the values a, b, and c and assigning values to them via destructuring
	• We can combine destructuring with the rest parameter to separate elements of an array out, then make a new array with the remaining elements
		
		const [a, b, …arr] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];
		console.log(a, b);
		// displays 1, 2
		console.log(arr);
		// displays [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
		
		○ This only works if the rest parameter is the last argument
	• We can destructure an object inside a function's argument
		
		// consider this
		const profileUpdate = (profileData) => {
			const { name, age, nationality, location } = profileData;
		}
		
		// This can be done in-place instead
		const profileUpdate = ({ name, age, nationality, location }) => {}
		/* This destructure the object as it's passed through
		the argument */

Template Literals
	• Template Literals are a special type of string that makes creating complex strings easier
		○ They allow us to create multi-line strings and to use interpolation features to create strings
		
		const person = {
			name: "Zodiac Hasbro",
			age: 56
		}:
		
		const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${person.name}!
		I am ${person.age} years old.`;
		
		console.log(greeting);
		/* displays the following:
		"Hellow, my name is Zodiac Hasbro!"
		"I am 56 years old."
		
		1. Notice the use of backticks instead of quotes to wrap the string
		2. Notice that the string is multiline in both code and output
			i. This save us from needing to insert \n
		3. The ${variable} syntax is a placeholder
			i. Saves us from needing to use + to concatenate
			ii. Anything can go inside the place holder, like ${a + b}
			iii. Flexibility!! :)

Objects in ES6
	• You can use shorthand to easily quickly assign values to object properties and avoid having to write redundencies
		
		// Consider this:
		const getMousePosition = (x, y) => ({
			x: x,
			y: y
		})
		
		// We can write it like this
		const getMousePosition = (x, y) => ({ x, y });
		
	• When defining functions inside object, we can shorten the code by removing the colon and the function keyword like so
		
		// Before
		const person= {
			name: "Taylor",
			sayHello: function() {
				return `Hello! my anem is ${this.name}.`;
			}
		};
		
		// After
		const person= {
			name: "Taylor",
			sayHello() {
				return `Hello! my anem is ${this.name}.`;
			}
		};
		
	• We can cretate objects with the class keyword
		○ This does not create a class-based implementation like Java or Python would, it just is the new way to create objects
		
		// ES5 old way
		var SpaceShuttle = function(targetPlanet) {
			this.targetPlane = targetPlanet;
		}
		var zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');
		
		// ES6 new way
		class SpaceShuttle {
			constructor(targetPlanet) {
				this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
			}
		}
		const zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');
		
		○ Note: UpperCamelCase should be used by convention for ES6 class names, like SpaceShuttle
		○ We'll learn more about constructor in the Object Oriented Programming section
	• We can create setters and getters to set and obtain values of properties within objects
		○ This allows us to control access to the object
		○ Getter and setter functions are created to access private values inside objects
		
		class Book {
			constructor(author) {
				this._author = author;
			}
			
			// getter
			get writer() {
				return this._author;
			}
			
			// setter
			set writer(updatedAuthor) {
				this._author = updatedAuthor;
			}
		}
		
		const novel = new Book('anonymous');
		console.log(novel.writer);
		// prints "anonymous"
		novel.writer = 'newAuthor':
		console.log(novel.writer);
		// prints "newAuthor"
		
		○ Note: it is convention to precede private variable names with an underscore. This is convention. It doesn't make a variable privat itself

Module Script
	• Module scripts allow us to easily share JavaScript code among various files
		○ This involves exporting parts of one file for use in others
		○ To do this, create a script in the HTML document with a type of module
		
		<script type="module" src="FileName.js"></script>
		
	• We can export specific functions with the export function
		
		export const add = (x, y) => {
			return x + y;
		}
		
		// We can also do it this way
		
		const add = (x, y) => {
			return x + y;
		}
		
		export { add };
		
		○ To export multiple functions, we would just place commas between the names of the functions
	• We can also import specific functions from one JavaScript document to another without exporting first
	
		imort { add } from './math_functions.js';
		
		○ ./ tells the import to look for the file in the same folder as the current file
	• To import everything from a file, we use import * as syntax
		
		import * as myMathModule from "./math_functions.js";
		
		○ Notice that we had to give the import a name.
		○ That's because when we use a function from this file, we have to call it from that name
		
		myMathModule.add(5, 3);
		myMathModule.subtract(5, 3);

	• The previous export was known as a named export. We can also do a default export
		○ This syntax will usually be used if only one value is being exported from a file
		○ It's also used to create a fallback value for a file or module
		○ Ther are two ways to do this:

		// option one
		export default funtion add(x, y) {
			return x + y;
		}
		
		// option two
		export default function( x, y ) {
			return x + y;
		}
		
		○ The first is named, the second is anonymous
		○ You can only have one default export per module or file
		○ It can also only be used on fuctions, not on var, let, or const
	• To import a default export:
		
		import add from "./math_functions.js";
		
		○ The key difference here is the lack of curly bracers
		○ This means that the name given is just a variable name for whatever the default export is.
		○ You can use any name here when importing a default

JavaScript Promises
	• A promise is used to make a promise to do something, usually asynchronously
		○ When the task completes, you either fulfill your promise of fail to do so
		○ Promise is a constructor function, so you need to use the keyword new
		○ It takes a function as an argument with 2 paramters, resolve and reject
		
		const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
			// some code
		});
		
	• A promise has 3 states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected
		○ The promise made above is forever stuck at pending because we didn't give it a way to complete the promise
		○ resolve and reject parameters are used to do this
		○ resolve is used when you want the promise to succeed
		○ reject is used when you want it to fail
		○ They are methods that take an argument:
		
		const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
			if(condition here) {
				resolve("Promise was fulfilled");
			} else {
				reject("Promise was rejected");
			}
		});
		
	• Promises are most useful when you have a process that takes an unknown amount of time I your code, often a server request
		○ When you make a request it takes time, and once it completes you usually want to do something with the response
		○ We do this by using the then method
		○ It is executed imediately after the promise is fullfilled with resolve
		
		myPromise.then(result => {
			// some code
		});
		
	• We can use the catch method to handle rejected promises
		
		myPrmose.catch(error => {
			// some code
		});
