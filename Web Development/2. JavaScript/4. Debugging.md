Checking the Console
	• You should be using Chrome or Firefox, so you can check the console
	• The console.log() function prints the output to the consol
		
		console.log('Hello World!');
		// prints 'Hello world!' to the console
	
	• Consoles don't clear automatically like on FreeCodeCamp
		○ Use console.clear() to clear the console's  log
	• You can use typeof to print a variable's type to the console
		
		console.log(typeof " ");
		// prints string
		console.log(typeof { });
		// prints object
		
Bugs
	• ReferrenceErrors occur when the code looks for an object that doesn't exist
		○ This is generally cause by misspelling or miscapitalizing names of function and variables
		○ Names are case sensitive
	• SyntaxErrors occur when the code is illegible by the computer
		○ This is commonly cause by unclosed parentheses, bracket, braces and quotes
		○ Another common cause is a mixed use of single and double quotes, causing strings to be wrapped early
	• Logic Errors will not be caught by the computer. They are case because our code's logic is wrong, so the output is incorrect
		○ A common reason for this is when we use assignment operators instead of logic operators (= instead of == or ===)
		○ Another common problem is passing arguments through functions in the wrong order
Off by one errors are common in loops.
