# Overview

Fetch proveds a generic definition of `Request` and `Response` object and other things involved in network requests. That way, they can be used werever they are needed in the future or any case that requires us to generate a response programmatcally.

It also defines concepts such a CORS and the HTTP Origin header semantics.

The `fetch()` method makes requests and fetches resources. It is available in almost all contexts where you would fetch resources since it is implemented in the `Window` and `WorkerGlobalScope` interfaces.
