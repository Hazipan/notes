	• Functional Programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope
		○ input -> process -> output
		○ Isolated Functions - There is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change
		○ Pure Funcitons - The same input always gives the same output
		○ Funcitons with limited side effects - any changes or mutations to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controled
	• Some terminology
		○ Callbacks - the funcitons that are passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function
		○ First Class Functions - Funcitons that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value
		○ Higher Order Functions - Functions that take a function as an arugment, or retrun a funciton as a return value.
		○ Lambdas - Functions that have been passed through or returned from other functions
	• Functional Programming is a very good habit to build
		○ We've used imperative style programming up until now
			§ Giving the computer a set of statements to perform a task
		○ Functional Programming is a declarative
			§ You tell the computer what you want done by calling methods or functions
		○ Funcitonal Programming helps us avoid tricky bugs, such as off by one errors when manipulating arrays
		○ The idea is that we don't change the information while we're working with it
			§ Such as changing an array twice, but the second change relies on the original array (common issue with the splice() function)
	• The core priciple of functional programming is Don’t Change Things
		○ Changes lead to bugs
		○ It easier to prevent bugs if you functions don't change anything
		○ Mutation is changing or altering things
			§ The outcome of which is called a side affect
		○ An ideal function is a Pure Function
			§ Doesn't cause any side affects
	• Pass arguments to avoid external dependencies in a function
		○ Always declare dependencies explicitly
			§ If a function depends on a variable or object being presnt, pass that variable or object directly into the funciton as an argument
		○ This makes functions easier to test because we know exactly what's going in and it doesn't depend on anything else in the program
		○ Creates confidence when you move, alter, or add new code
		○ Also makes it so that the function always produces the same output for the same input, no matter what

Main points so far
	• Don't alter a variable or object, create new varables and objecs and return them if need be from a function
	• Declare function parameters so that any computation inside the function depends only on the arguments passed into the fuciton, and not any global objects or variables

Tools for Functional Programming

The map method
	• Functions are first class objects meaning they behaive like any other object and can be stored in variables, stored in objects, or passed as arguments
	• The map method (Array.prototype.map()) iterates over each item in an array and returns a new array containing the resuls of calling the callback function on each element.
		○ It does this without mutatin the original array
	• The callback has 3 arguments
		1. The current element being processed
		2. The index of that element
		3. The array that the map method was called
	
		const users = [
		  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
		  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
		  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
		];
		
		const names = users.map(user => user.name);
		/* looks insed the user array and finds each user.name property */
		console.log(names);
		// prints ['John', 'Amy', 'camperCat']
		
	• You can change how the map method works by setting it to something different in a prototype of an array object
		
		Array.prototype.myMap = function(callback) {
			const newArray = [];
			for(let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
				newArray.push(callback(this[i]));
			}
			return newArray;
		};
		/* 
		This behaves the same way as the normal map function,
		but we could change it to do other things
		*/
		
The filter method
	• filter() calls a function on each element of an array and returns a new array containing only the elements for which that function retruns true
	• It does not modify the original array
	• The callback has 3 arguments
		1. The current element being processed
		2. The index of that element
		3. The array that the filter method is called on
		
		const users = [
			{ name: 'John', age: 34 },
			{ name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
			{ name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
		];
		
		const usersUnder30 = users.filter(user => user.age < 30);
		console.log(usersUnder30); 
		/*
		prints [ { name: 'Amy', age: 20 }, { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 } ]
		*/
		
	• Just like with the map() method, you can change how the filter function works by implementing it on a prototype
		
		Array.prototype.myFilter = function(callback) {
			const newArray = [];
			for(let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
				if(callback(this[i])) {
					newArray.push(this[i]);
				}
			}
			return newArray;
		};
		
The slice method
	• The slice() method has been covered before
	• It works the same as splice, but it does not affect the original array like splice would
		○ It copies data into another variable
	• It takes 2 arguments
		1. The index to begin on
		2. The index to end on (non-inclusive)
		
		const arr = ['Cat', 'Dog', 'Tiger', 'Zebra'];
		const newArr = arr.slice(1, 3);
		// returns ['Dog', 'Tiger']

The concat method
	• The concat() method can be used on string or arrays
	• It is called on one and uses another as the arugment, returning a new array or string that is the concatenation of both
	
		[1, 2, 3].concat([4, 5, 6]);
		// returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
	
	• We can use concat() instead of push() to add elements to the end of an array without mutating the original

The reduce method
	• This method allows for a more general forms of array processing
	• It iterates over each item and retruns a single value (i.e. string, number, object, array)
		○ This is done via a callback function that is called on each iteration
	• The callback accepts 4 arguments
		1. The accumulator, which gets assigned the return value of the callback from the previous iteration
		2. The current element being processed
		3. The index of that element
		4. The array that .reduce() is being called on
	• In addition to the callback fuction, there is a second parameter that takes the initial value for the accumulator
		○ If the second parameter is not used, then the first iteration is skipped and the second iteration gets passed the first element of the array as the accumulator
		
		const users = [
			{ name: 'John', age: 34 },
			{ name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
			{ name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
		];
		
		const sumOfAges = users.reduce((sum, user) => sum + user.age, 0);
		console.log(sumOfAges);
		// prints 64
		
		○ Another example return and object with the name of users as properties and their ages as value
		
		const users = [
			{ name: 'John', age: 34 },
			{ name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
			{ name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
		];
		
		const usersObj = users.reduce((obj, user) => {
			obj[user.name] = user.age;
			return obj;
		}, {});
		console.log(usersObj);
		// prints { John: 34, Amy: 20, camperCat: 10 }
		
The sort method
	• The sort() method sorts the elements of an array according to the call back function
		
		function ascendingOrder(arr) {
			return arr.sort(function(a, b) {
				return a - b;
			});
		}
		
		ascendingOrder([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]);
		// returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
		
		○ An example with characters
		
		function reverseAlpha(arr) {
			return arr.sort(function(a, b) {
				return a === b ? 0 : a < b ? 1 : -1;
			});
		}
		
		reverseAlpha(['l', 'h', 'z', 'b', 's']);
		// retuns ['z', 's', 'l', 'h', 'b']
		
	• JavaScript's default sorting method is by string Unicode point value, which can return unexpected results
		○ Therefore, you should provide a callback function to specify how to sort the array
		○ When this is done, the array is sorted by the return value
	• The sort() method mutates the original array, so be sure to initially use the slice() or concat() method to avoid mutating the original array
		
		const globalArray = [5, 6, 3, 2, 9];
		
		function nonMutatingSort(arr) {
			let newArr = [].concat(arr);
			newArr.sort(function(a, b) {
				return a - b;
			});
			return newArr;
		}
		
		nonMutatingSort(globalArray);
		
The split method
	• The split() method splits a string into an array of strings
		○ It takes an argument for the delimiter (the character to use to break up the string)
			§ It can be a regular expression
		
		const str = "Hello World";
		const bySpace = str.split(" ");
		// returns ['Hello', 'World']
		
		const otherString = "How9are7you2today";
		const byDigits = otherString.split(/\d/);
		// returuns ['How', 'are', 'you', 'today']
		
	• Strings are immutable, so the split() method makes it easier to work with them

The join method
	• The join() method works in the opposite way that the split() method works
		○ It joins an array into one string, using its argument as the charcter inbetween
		
		const arr = ['Hello', 'World'];
		const str = arr.join(' ');
		// returns 'Hello World'

The every method
	• The every() method checks if every element in an array passes a particular test
		○ It returns true if all values meet the criteria and false if they don't
		
		const numbers = [1, 5, 8, 0, 10, 11];
		
		return numbers.every(function(currentValue) {
			return currentValue < 10;
		});
		// returns false
		
The some method
	• The some() method checks to see if any element passes a particular test
		○ Returns true if any values meet the criteria, returns false otherwise
		
		const numbers = [10, 50, 8, 220, 110, 11];
		
		return numbers.some(function(currentValue) {
			return currentValue < 10;
		}];
		//returns true
		
Intro to Currying and Partial Application
	• The arity of a function is the number of arguments it requires
	• Currying a function means to convert a function of N arity into N functions of 1 arity
	• In other words, it restructures a function so it takes one argument, then returns another function that takes the next argument, and so on.
		
		function unCurried(x, y) {
			return x + y;
		}
		
		function curried(x) {
			return function(y) {
				return x + y;
			}
		}
		
		const curried = x => y => x + y
		
		curried(1)(2)
		// returns 3
		
		○ This is useful if you can't supply all the arguments to a function at one time
		○ You can save each funciton call into a variable, which will hold the return function reference that takes the next argument when it's available
		○ An example using the above curried function as such:
		
		const funcForY = curried(1);
		console.log(funcForY(2));
		// prints 3
		
	• Partial application can be described as applying a few arguments to a function at a time and returning another function that is applied to more arguments
		
		function impartial(x, y, z) {
			return x + y + z;
		}
		
		const partialFn = impartial.bind(this, 1, 2);
		partialFn(10); 
		// returns 13
