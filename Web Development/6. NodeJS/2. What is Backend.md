Front and Back
	• The front-end is everything the user interacts with
		○ It's built from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and static assets
			§ Static assets are files that do not change
	• The back-end is everything that happens behind the scenes processes and data that makes the website function, and allows it to send resources to clients
The Web Server
	• The front-end is the information sent to the client so the user can see and interact with a website. 
		○ All that information comes form the web server!
	• "Server" can mean a lot of things, so we will focus on web servers
		○ A web server is a process running on a computer that listens for incoming requests for information over the internet and sens back responses
		○ Each time a user navigates to a website, their browser is making a request to the web server of that website
	• The specific format of a request (and the response) is called to protocol
		○ HTTP is the protocol used to access websites
	• With the simplest website, the client makes a single request, the web server receives the request, and it sends the client a response containing everything needed to view the website
		○ This is a static website - non-interactive; once the files are received, they do not change or move
	• To create a webpage that can change and move - a dynamic website - we need a more complex back-end
What is the Back-end?
	• Modern web applications often cater to the specific user, rather than sending the same files to every visitor of the webpage
		○ This is dynamic content
		○ Like at a restaurant. Each patron orders to their own tastes, the restaurant doesn't serve the same food to every person.
	• The collection of programming logic required to deliver dynamic content to a client, manage security, process payments, and a myriad of other tasks is sometimes known as the "application" or application server
		○ It can be responsible for anything form sending an email confirmation after a purchase to running complicated algorithms a search engine uses to give us meaningful results
Storing Data
	• Data is a big deal, and modern web application collect a lot  of it.
		○ For that data to be usefule, it needs to be orgaized and stored somewhere
	• The back-ends of modern web applications include some sort of database, often more than one.
		○ Data bases are collections of information and there are many different ones
		○ They can be divided into two types: relational and non-relation (NoSQL) databases
			§ Relational databases store information in tables with columns and rows
			§ Non-Realatinal databases store information in other systems, such as key-value pairs or a document storage model
		○ SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming for accessing and changing data stored in relational databases
			§ Popular relational databases: MySQL and PostgreSQL
			§ Popular NoSQL databses: MongoDB and Redis
	• In addition to the database istself, the back-end needs a way to programmatically access, change, and analyze the data stored there
What is an API?
	• When a user is looking at a product on an e-commerce site, the price listed for that item is stored in a database, and when they purchase it, the database will need to be updated with the correct inventroy for that item
		○ Much of the back-end entails reading, updating, or deleting information stored in a database
	• To have a consistent wat of interacting with data, a back-end will often include a Web API (Application Program Interface)
		○ A Web API is a collection of predefined ways of, or rules for, interacting with a web application's data, often through an HTTP request-response cycle
		○ Unlike the HTTP requests a client makes when a user navigates to a website's URL, this type of request indicates how it would like to interact with a web application's data (create new data, read existing data, updating existing data, or delete existing data; CRUD) , and it receives some data back as a response.
	• Back to the buying an item from an e-commerce site:
		○ When the user presses the button to submit an order, that will trigger a request to send them to a different view of the website, an order confirmation page, but an additional request will be triggered from the front-end, unseen by the user, to the web API so that the database can be updated with the information from the order.
	• Some APIs are public and any developer can use it, others are only used by the web application internally
Authorization and Authentication
	• Two important concepts that we'll want our server-side logic to handle are Authentication and Authorization
	• Authentication is the process of validating the identity of a user
		○ One technique for authentication is to use logins with usernames and passwords
		○ These credentials need to be securly stored in the back-end on a database and checked upon each visit
		○ Web applications can also use external resources for authentication (Google, Facebook, Github)
	• Authorization controls which users have access to which resources and actions
		○ Certain application views, like the page to edit a social media personal profiles, are only accessible to that user
		○ Other activities, like deleting a post, are often similarly restricted
	• When building a robust back-end, we need to incorporate both authentication and authorization to make sure we're creating a secure, personalized, and dynamic content.
Different Back-end Stacks
	• Unlike the front-end, there's a lot of flexibility in which technologies can be used to create the back-end of a web application
	
		Framework	Language
		Laravel	PHP
		Express.js	JavaScript
		Ruby on Rails	Ruby
		Spring	Java
		JSF	Java
		Flask	Python
		Django	Python
		ASP.NET	C#

	• The collection of technologies used to create the front-end and back-end of a web application is referred to as a stack
		○ This is where the term full-stack developer comes from
		○ Example -  The MEAN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js
