Node REPL
	• REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) is a program that loops through reading user input, evaluating the user input, and printing the evaluation to the console
	• To access the Node.js REPL, type node into the console and press enter
		○ This can be used to experiment with JS and get immediate feedback
		
Core Modules
	• Modularity is a software design technique where one program has distinct parts, each providing a sing piece of the overall functionality
		○ These separate modules come together to build a cohesive whole
		○ It is essential for creating scalable programs which incorporate libraries and frameworks and separate the program's concerns into manageable chuncks
		○ A module is a collection of code located in a file
			§ Instead of having the entire program in one single file, code is organized into separate files based on the concerns they address
			§ These files can then be included in other files by using the require() funciton
	• To save us the time of reinventing the wheel, Node.js has several built-in modules to perform common tasks efficiently
		○ The core modules
		○ These modules are defined withing Node.js's source code, in the lib/ folder
		○ Core modules can be required by passing a string with the name of the module into the require() funciton
		
		// Require in the "events" core module:
const events = require("events");
		
	• Some core modules are inside other core modules
		○ Example: the util module can be used in the console module to format messages
		
The Console Module
	• This is the most commonly used Node.js module
	• In Node.js, the terminal is used to send and receive text feedback to and from a program, often for debugging purposes
		○ The built-in console module exports a global console object that gives the terminal this functionality
		○ The console object provides many methods
			§ .log() - prints messages to the terminal
			§ .assert() - prints a message to the terminal if the value is falsy
			§ .table() - prints out a table in the terminal frm an object or array
	• Since console is a global module, its methods can be accessed from anywhere, and the require() function is not necessary

The Process Module
	• In CS, a process is the instance of a computer program that is being executed
		○ Node has a global process object with useful methods and information about the current process
	• The process.env property is an object which stores and controls information about the environment in which the process is currently running
		○ One useful property is the PWD property which holds a string with the directory in which the current process is located
		○ We can use the process.env object o have some if/else logic in a program depending on the current environment
		○ One convention is to add a property to process.env with the key NODE_ENV with a value of either production or development
		
		if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
		  console.log("Testing!");
		}
		
	• process.memoryUsage() returns information on the CPU demands of the current process
		○ It returns something similar to this:
		
		{ rss: 26247168,
		  heapTotal: 5767168,
		  heapUsed: 3573032,
		  external: 8772 }
		
		○ Heap can mean different things in different context
			§ It can refer to a spcific data structure, but can also refer to a block of computer memory
			§ process.memoryUsage().heapUsed method will return a number representing how many bytes of memory the current process is using
	• process.argv holds an array of command line values provided when the current process was initiated
		○ The first element in the array is the absolute path to Node, which ran the process
		○ The second element in the array is the path to the file that's running
		○ The following elements will be command line argumetns that were provided when the process was initiated
			§ Command line argumetns are separated form one another with spaces
			
		node myProgram.js testing several features
		
		console.log(process.argv[3]); // Prints "several"
		
	• There's a lot more to explore in the process object, so be sure to check out the documentation: https://devdocs.io/node~16_lts-process/
	
The OS Module
	• This module allows ut to have information bout the computer, operating system, and network on which the program is running
		○ Before Node.js, this wasn't possbile becauase JavaScript was confined to the browser
	• The os module is not global, so to use it in a program, you must require it
		
		const os = require('os');
		
	• Using this module, we can call many methods:
		○ os.type() - returns the computer's operating system
		○ os.arch() - returns the operating system CPU architecture
		○ os.networkInterfaces() - returns information about the network interfaces of the ocmputer like the IP and MAC address
		○ os.homedir() - returns the current user's home directory
		○ os.hostname() - returns the hostname of the operating system
		○ os.uptime() - returns the system uptime, in seconds

The Util Module
	• Utility functions are outlier functions that are used to maintain code and debug certain aspects of a programs functionality
		○ They usually don't create new functionallity, but you can think of them as internal tools used to maintain and debug your code
		○ The util module contains methods specifically designed for this
	• The util.types object provides methods for runtime type checking
		
		const util = require('util');
		 
		const today = new Date();
		const earthDay = 'April 22, 2022';
		 
		console.log(util.types.isDate(today)); // outputs true
		console.log(util.types.isDate(earthDay)); // outputs false
		
		○ The variable today is a Date object, but the variable earthDay is a string
	• The util.promisify() method turns callback funtions into promises
		○ Asynchronous programming is essential to Node.js, and in the beginning this was achieved using error-first callback functions, which are still very prevalent in the Node ecosystem today
		○ Promises are often preferred over callback, and especially nested callbacks, so Node offers a way to turn these into promises
		
		function getUser (id, callback) {
		  return setTimeout(() => {
		    if (id === 5) {
		      callback(null, { nickname: 'Teddy' })
		    } else {
		      callback(new Error('User not found'))
		    }
		  }, 1000)
		}
		 
		function callback (error, user) {
		  if (error) {
		    console.error(error.message)
		    process.exit(1)
		  }
		 
		  console.log(`User found! Their nickname is: ${user.nickname}`)
		}
		 
		getUser(1, callback) // -> `User not found`
		getUser(5, callback) // -> `User found! Their nickname is: Teddy`
		
		○ The above code queries a database for a specified user ID.
			§ getUser methods are very common in back-end applications, and most will also support error-first callbacks
			§ Since a database query typically taks longer to run than other operations, we simulate the query with a setTimeout() method that executes a callback after 1 second
			§ If the user ID is found, the callback function is executed with null passed in as the argument for the error parameter, and an object containing the returned user information is passed in as an argument for the user parameter
			§ If the user ID is not found, the callback function is executed, passing in a new Error as the argument for the error parameter (the second argument is not necessary since the funciton will end in the case of an error)
		○ This way of handling this function may seem a bit convoluted, but with .promisify(), we can easily change it into a modern, cleaner, more maintainable version
		
		const getUserPromise = util.promisify(getUser);
		 
		getUserPromise(id)
		  .then((user) => {
		      console.log(`User found! Their nickname is: ${user.nickname}`);
		  })
		  .catch((error) => {
		      console.log('User not found', error);
		  });
		 
		getUser(1) // -> `User not found`
		getUser(5) // -> `User found! Their nickname is: Teddy`
		
		○ We declare a getUserPromise variable that stores the getUser method turned into a promise using the .promisify() method. 
			§ With that in place, we’re able to use getUserPromise with .then() and .catch() methods (or we could also use the async...await syntax here) to resolve the promise returned or catch any errors.
