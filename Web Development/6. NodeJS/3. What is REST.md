REpresentational State Transfer
	• REST is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it esier for systems to communicate with each other
	• REST-complient systems (refered to as RESTful systems) are characterized by how they are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server
Separation of Client and Server
	• In REST architecture, the implementation of the client and the implementation of the server can be done independently wihtout each knowing about the other
		○ Meaning client code can be changed without affecting the server and server code can be changed without affecting the client
	• As long as they both know how to format their communications messages, they can be kept modular and separate.
		○ This allows each component to be able to evolve independently, improves flexibility across platforms, and improves scaleablitity
	• With a RESTful interface, all clients hit the same endpoints, can perform the same actions, and get the same responses.
Statelessness
	• Being stateless means the server doesn't need to know what state the client is in to be able to communicate and vice versa
		○ They can both understand any messages without needing to know previous messages
		○ This is enforced via resources instead of commands
			§ Resources are documents, object, or any other thing that may need to be stored or sent to other services
	• Since REST systems interact through resources, they don't require any interfaces
	• These constraints allow RESTful applications to be reliable, quick, and scalable
		○ It also allows its components to be managed, updated, and reused without affecting the whole system, even while the system is actively running

Communication between Client and Server
	• In REST architecture, clients send request to the server to retrieve or modify resources, and the server sends back responses
Making Requests
	• A Request generally consists of:
		○ an HTTP verb to define the kind of operation to perform
		○ a header that allows the client to pass along information inside the request
		○ a path to a resource
		○ an optional message body containing data
HTTP Verbs
	• There are 4 basic HTTP verbs that are using in a REST system
		○ GET - retrieve a specific resource or colleciton of resources
		○ POST - create a new resource
		○ PUT - updata a specific resource
		○ DELETE - remove a specific resource
	• More information here: https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-crud
		○ This article talks about CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete), the 4 basic functions that models should be able to do
Headers and Accept parameters
	• In the header of a request, the client sends the type of content that it is able receive
	• This is called the Accept field
		○ This way, it doesn't receive a resource type that it cannot process
		○ The options for types of content are MIME (Mulipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) types
			§ Read more on that: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types
	• MIME types used to specify the Accept field consist of a type and a subtype, separated by a slash
		○ You've seen this in <link> HTML statements
		○ Some common MIME types
			§ text/html, text/css, text/plain
			§ image/png, image/jpeg, image/gif
			§ video/mp4, video/ogg
			§ application/json, application/pdf, application/xml, application/octet-stream
Paths
	• Requests must contain a path to the resource that the operation should be performed on.
		○ In RESTful APIs, paths should be designed to help the client understand what's happening
	• Conventionally, the first part of the path is the plural form of the resource
		○ This keeps nested paths simple and easy to understand
		○ Something like fashionboutique.com/customers/223/order/12 is clear on what it points to, even if you've never seen it before
Sending Responses
Content Types
	• Just like in the accept field of a client request, you must also include a content-type field in the header of the response
Response Codes
	• For each verb in the RESTful model, there is an expected response code on success
		○ GET - return 200 (OK)
		○ POST - return 202 (CREATED)
		○ PUT - return 200 (OK)
DELETE - return 204 (NO CONTENT)
