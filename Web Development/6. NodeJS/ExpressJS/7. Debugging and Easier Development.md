Use NPM and Create your own Scripts
	• Using npm, we can create scripts to make terminal commands easier
	• First, use npm init to create a node project and generate a package.json file
		○ In our package file, we can add a start script and set it to node projectName.js
		○ Now, we can just navigate to the project directory and run "npm start"
		
		{
		  "name": "udemy-follow-along",
		  "version": "1.0.0",
		  "description": "",
		  "main": "app.js",
		  "scripts": {
		    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
		    "start": "node app.js"
		  },
		  "author": "",
		  "license": "ISC"
		}
		
		○ We can create any script we want via this syntax
			§ Just make sure there is no white space at all
	• The start command in npm is a special command recognized by npm, so we can just run npm start and the script will work
		○ For most other script we will need to include the run keyword to let npm know that we are running a custom script
			§ npm run my-script

Nodemon Package
	• Nodemon will save us the trouble of restarting our server every time we change a file
	• We can install packages and specify if the package will be a development package, or a package to be used in deployment
		○ Use the --save-dev flag to register the package as a dvelopment package when installing via npm
		○ Use the --save flag to register the package as a deployment package when installing via npm
		○ You can also use the -g flag to install a package globally and use it anywhere
			§ Global packages can have their scripts used in the terminal from anywhere
	• Nodemon is a utility that lets us run the application through it, and it will automatically restart our application anytime a change is made
		○ To use it, we can change our start script to nodemon app.js

Debugging
	• Logic errors (code runs, but has the wrong output) can be tough to fix.
		○ To help us, we can use the integrated JS debugger tool in Visual Studio Code
		○ Run > Start Debugging (F5)
	• The debugger will allow us to look inside out code as it runs, but to do this we need to set breakpoints where we think the code may be incorrect
		○ To set a break point, go the the left of the line number and click on the red dot
	• When our code snippet that we think is causing the issue is run, the code will halt completely, and that line will become highlighted
		○ From here, we can hover over each piece of line to get details about what's inside each piece
	• We can also go to view > debug to get a special debug pane that helps us see even more information
		○ Here we can also create watchers, were we can input variables or other things to always see what data that item holds
		○ It will also show our call stack to let us see the stack of callbacks that led us to where we are
		○ We can also change the value of any items we want quickly
	• In the moveable tool bar, we can resume our code (which will stop at our next breakpoint), progress step by step through the code, or navigate function by function
	• In our debug console, we can also type out code
		○ If we type a variable name, it will return its value
		○ We can also run operations on them that will not affect our code in any way
	• If you change your code files, you'll have to restart your debugger, but we can automate this
		○ Go to run > add configuration
		○ This adds the .vscode folder with a launch.json file
		○ If we add "restart": true and "runtimeExecutable": "nodemon", the debugger will restart anytime our program is changed, just like how the program restarts whenever it's changed
			§ For this to work, nodemon must be installed gloabally
		○ We can also add "cosole": "integratedTerminal" so that all of our terminal output is in the same location, instead of strewn between the debug console and the integrated terminal
			§ Use this if you use nodemon, because you have to terminate nodemon and the debugger when you want to stop debugging
	• In the end, the launch.json file should look something like this:
		
		
		{
		  "version": "0.2.0",
		  "configurations": [
		    {
		      "type": "node",
		      "request": "launch",
		      "name": "Launch Program",
		      "skipFiles": [
		        "<node_internals>/**"
		      ],
		      "program": "${workspaceFolder}\\Udemy Course\\follow along\\app.js",
		      "restart": true,
		      "runtimeExecutable": "nodemon",
		      "console": "integratedTerminal"
		    }
		  ]
		}
