Creating Dynamic URLs
	• There are many situations where we would want to create dynamic URLs to lead to data specific views
		○ To do this, we can easily just make sure that our Models get unique ids any time we instantiate an object
		○ This will allow us to use this id to dynamically create unique URLs for each data item
		
		<a href="/item/<%=item.id%>">To Details</p>
		
		○ This uses EJS to create a dynamic url so that we can display the unique details of this data item
		
Extracting Dynamic Parameters
	• Now that we can pass dynamic data into our route, we need to extract it
	• To do that, we can use route placeholders
		○ Express allows us to create route place holders by prefacing a part of the path with a colon (:)
		○ This will let Express know that that part f the path could be anything and Express will store it inside the req.params object for us to access
		
		
		router.get("/products/:productId", (req, res, next) => {
		  const id = req.params.productId;
		  console.log(id); // Logs the id from the URL to the console
		};
		
	• And from here, we can access the item via the id through our models and controllers
