# Managing Data (w/o a Database)

One way we can store data and share it across our server without a database, is via simple variables
		○ We can push user data to an array, then export that array so it can be used in other files across our server
		○ The data will be shared across all users, so long as the server is runnind continuously
		○ This is not something you generally want! It's a big security issue
			§ But we're gonna use this approach for now, until we learn more
			
Templating Engines
	• Templating Engines allow us to create dynamic content
	• We can create HTML templates that have some placeholder syntax through out
		○ Then, using Node/Express data and a Template Engine, we can replace the placeholders with actual HTML content, thus generating data specific views
		○ The template engine is what scans our HTML, looks for specific syntax, then replaces that syntax with the data we tell it to use
	• Free, popular templating engines
		○ EJS
			§ Example syntax: <p><%= name%></p>
			§ Normal HTML and plain JS used in the template
		○ Pug (originally Jade)
			§ Example syntax: p #{name}
			§ Uses minimal HTML and custom template language
		○ Handlebars
			§ Exampe syntax: <p>{{ name }}</p>
			§ Uses HTML and custom template language
	• To get started with these templating engines, we have to set an express configuration variable, to let express know that we want to use a templating engine
		○ We can set "view engine" to tell express to render dynamic templates through our template engine
		
		app.set('view engine', 'pug');
		// must install pug via npm i --save-dev pug
		
		○ Then we can tell express where to find our dynamic views via the "views" config variable 
			§ It defaults to "/views" from the root of our project
		
		app.set('views', 'templates');
		
Rendering Through the Template Engine
	• Once we've told express what engine to use and create a dynamic file (.pug in this case), we need to serve the rendered page via the res.render() method
		○ This works just like the res.sendFile() method, but we don't need to construct the path to our views folder or include the file extension, since the default path is our views folder with our configuration variables that we set earlier
		
		res.render('myFile');
		
	• To inject data into our dynamic file, we can use a second argument in the res.render() method
		○ The second argument needs to be an object, so we can create an object and map our data to specific keys that can then be access in our dynamic file
			
		res.render('myFile', {data: myData});
		
Pug
	• Pug templates are stored in .pug files
	• We can't just copy and paste plain HTML since pug uses special syntax
		○ In Visual Studio Code, we can create a .pug file, then type in html and use the popup to generate a .pug html starter code
	• Best way to learn pug syntax is via pug documentation
	• Indentation in pug is requried
		○ indented = child
		○ same level = sibling
	• Exaple pug file
		
		doctype html
		html(lang="en")
		  head
		    meta(charset="UTF-8")
		    meta(http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible", content="IE=edge")
		    meta(name="viewport", content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0")
		    title Shop
		    link(rel="stylesheet", href="/css/main.css");
		    link(rel="stylesheet", href="/css/product.css")
		  body 
		    header.main-header 
		      nav.main-header__nav
		        ul.main-header__item-list
		          li.main-header__item
		            a.active(href="/") Shop
		          li.main-header__item
		            a(href="/admin/add-product") Add Product
		
		
	• To access the data inside our .pug file, we use the #{} syntax and access any object fields that were declared in the second argument of the .render() method
		
		title #{data}
		
	• We can iterate through arrays via the each…in syntax
		
		each item in myData
		
		○ The scope of the loop is determined by the indentations in the file
	• You can also use conditionals
	• Larger .pug file example:
		
		
		doctype html
		html(lang="en")
		  head
		    meta(charset="UTF-8")
		    meta(http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible", content="IE=edge")
		    meta(name="viewport", content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0")
		    title #{docTitle}
		    link(rel="stylesheet", href="/css/main.css")
		    link(rel="stylesheet", href="/css/product.css")
		  body 
		    header.main-header 
		      nav.main-header__nav
		        ul.main-header__item-list
		          li.main-header__item
		            a.active(href="/") Shop
		          li.main-header__item
		            a(href="/admin/add-product") Add Product
		  main 
		    if products.length > 0
		      .grid
		        each product in products
		          article.card.product-item
		            header.card__header
		                h1.product__title #{product.title}
		                    </header>
		            .card__image
		              img(src=#{product.srcImg}, alt="A Book")
		            .card__content
		              h2.product__price #{product.price}
		              p.product__description #{product.description}
		            .card__actions
		              button.btn Add to Cart
		    else 
		      h1 No Products
		
	• Official Pug Docs: https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html
	• Throughout our views, we could end up with a lot of code that gets reused
		○ For example, a header at the top of our page
	• We can extend one pug view inside another pug view to reuse our code in multiple places
		○ To do this, we can create a layout .pug file that has all the code that we will reuse in our other files, and we can create hooks using the block keyword
		
		
		doctype html
		html(lang="en")
		  head
		    meta(charset="UTF-8")
		    meta(http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible", content="IE=edge")
		    meta(name="viewport", content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0")
		    title #{docTitle}
		    link( rel="stylesheet", href="/css/main.css")
		    block styles
		  body 
		    header.main-header
		      nav.main-header__nav
		        ul.main-header__item-list
		          li.main-header__item
		            a(href="/") Shop
		          li.main-header__item
		            a(href="/admin/add-product") Add Product
		    main 
		      block content
		
	• Now, we can create other .pug files by using this as a template
		○ example, a 404 page:
		
		
		extends layouts/main-layout.pug
		block content
		  h1 404: Page not Found
		
		
		○ Here, we extended the layout we created above, then used block content to hook into that section of the layout and create our own content
		○ Note that the block hook is not indented

Handlebars
	• Handle bars uses plain html with special syntax mised in
	• Configuring express to use handle bars is a bit different
		○ With pug we were able to do app.set("view engine", "pug") but we could only do that because pug is already registered in express, but some other engines aren't
		○ To register the handlebars template engine, we first need to import it
		
		const handlebars = require("express-handlebars");
		
		○ Then, we use the .engine() method to register the new template engine
			§ The method accepts 2 argument, the first being the name we  want to define for the engine and the second being the engine itself
		
		app.engin("handlebars", handlebars());
		
		○ Then, make sure you set the view engine to the new template engine that you registered
		
		app.set("view engine", "handlebars");
		
	• The files associated with the template engine need to have a file extention that matches the name we defined for the engine
		○ In this case, we need to use .handlebars files
	• Handlebars uses plain html, but to access imported data, we simply wrap it in double curly braces
		
		<p>{{ myData }}</p>
		
	• One important note about handlebars: you cannot perform any logic inside a handlebars file
		○ Handlebars only supports data that has direct content
		○ So, you could not access the length of an array to perform logic, instead you have to create a separate key-value pair and pass it into the template
		○ This forces you to keep all your logic inside the express files, which is good because it helps keep your code organized and readable
			§ The template is about displaying content, express is about logic
	• To create conditionals, we use #if
		
		{{#if condition}}
		  ...code to run...
		{{else}}
		  ...code to run...
		{{/if}
		
		○ The lack of space between the opening braces and the # symbol is important
	• To iterate through a data set, we use the each keyword
		○ To access the element of the current iteration, we use the this keyword
		
		{{each myArray}}
		  <p>{{this}}</p>
		{{/each}}
		
	• To make layouts in handlebars, we have to configure it in first
		○ When you register the handlebarse template engine in express, we can a layout directory
			§ The default is 'views/layouts' so no need to set this unless you store your layouts somewhere else
			
		const expressHbs = require("express-handlebars");
		app.engine("hbs", expressHbs({layoutsDir: "views/layouts"}));
		
		○ We can also set the default layout (which we should) by telling the engine the name of our main layout file in our view folder
		○ You also need to add an extension name field, otherwise handlebars doesn't know what type of file it's looking for
			
		app.engine("hbs", expressHbs({
		  layoutsDir: "views/layouts", 
		  defaultLayout: "main-layout",
		  extname: "hbs"
		}));
		
	• From here we can create a layout page
		○ For layouts in handle bars, the only placeholder we can create is for the main contenet of the page by using {{{ body }}}
		○ Any other dynamic content will have to be created via conditional statements
	• All handlebar pages will use the main layout you defined, unless you pass layout: false inside the data object you pass into the render function
		○ You only write what you want to be injected at the {{{ body }}} tag
	• I do not like handlebars
		○ So far, Pug is waaaayyyyy easier to use and requires a lot less work arounds

EJS
	• Is similar to pug in functionality, but uses HTML instead of a more lean, custom syntax
		○ EJS does not support layouts
	• To access passed in data, we use EJS syntax
		
		<title><%=myData&></title>
		
		○ The = symbol is only used when directly outputing information
		○ If you're not directly outputing data, the = is ommited and we can right vanilla JS code inside
		
		<% ...Some JS code... %>
		
	• To create an if statement in EJS, we can split our JS between EJS "tags" and have plain HTML between
		
		<% if(condition) { %>
		  <p>Some HTML</p>
		<% } %>
		
	• EJS doesn't have layouts like Pug and Handlebars, but it does support partials (Pug and Handlebars also support this feature)
		○ We can create .ejs files that contain snippets of EJS code, then plug those into other .ejs files
		○ We include partials with <%- include() %> syntax
		
		<head>
		  <%- include("./partials/head.ejs") %>
		</head>
		
		○ The path passed into the include funtion is the path to the file, relative to the current file 
		○ If you were to use = instead of -, it would display the content as text instead of actually running the code
