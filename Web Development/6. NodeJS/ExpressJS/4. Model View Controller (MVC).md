	• The MVC is a specific way of structuring and organizing our code
	• Its all about a separation of concerns
		○ Models - Represesnt our data in code and working with out data
		○ Views - What the user sees. Decoupled from our application code
		○ Controllers - Connections between our models and our views. The in-between logic
			§ They define which models and view to work with depending on the request that is received, and handle the logic that links our data with what the user sees
			§ The middleware we've been defining inside our routes are controllers
	• Controller Example:
			
		// Routing file: "routes/shop.js"
		const express = require('express');
		const productsController = require("../controllers/products")
		const router = express.Router();
		router.get('/', productsController.getProduct);
		module.exports = router;
		
		// Controller file: "controllers/products.js"
		const products = [];
		exports.getAddProduct = (req, res, next) => {
		  res.render('add-product', {
		    pageTitle: 'Add Product',
		    path: '/admin/add-product',
		    formsCSS: true,
		    productCSS: true,
		    activeAddProduct: true
		  })
		}
		
		exports.postAddProduct = (req, res, next) => {
		  products.push({ title: req.body.title });
		  res.redirect('/');
		}
		
		exports.getProduct = (req, res, next) => {
		  res.render('shop', {
		    prods: products,
		    pageTitle: 'Shop',
		    path: '/',
		    hasProducts: products.length > 0,
		    activeShop: true,
		    productCSS: true
		  });
		}
		
		○ This is an example of how to organize our code by using controllers
			§ Middleware that handles the inbetween logic for our views and our data
	• This is, however, missing a crucial element, Models
		○ Models are how we store and manipulate our data
		○ We should separate this logic into their own files
		○ Currently we're using an array within our controller
	• Example that uses Models and Controllers
		
		// Model file: "/models/Product.js"
		const products = [];
		module.exports = class Product {
		  constructor(title) {
		    this.title = title;
		  }
		  save() {
		    products.push(this);
		  }
		  static fetchAll() {
		    return products;
		  }
		}
		
		// Controller File: "/controllers/products.js"
		const Product = require("../models/product");
		exports.getAddProduct = (req, res, next) => {
		  res.render('add-product', {
		    pageTitle: 'Add Product',
		    path: '/admin/add-product',
		    formsCSS: true,
		    productCSS: true,
		    activeAddProduct: true
		  })
		}
		exports.postAddProduct = (req, res, next) => {
		  const product = new Product(req.body.title);
		  product.save();
		  res.redirect('/');
		}
		exports.getProduct = (req, res, next) => {
		  const products = Product.fetchAll();
		  res.render('shop', {
		    prods: products,
		    pageTitle: 'Shop',
		    path: '/',
		    hasProducts: products.length > 0,
		    activeShop: true,
		    productCSS: true
		  });
		}
