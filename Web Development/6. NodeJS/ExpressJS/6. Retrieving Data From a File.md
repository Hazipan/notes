	• Node.js is asynchronous, which can cause some headaches when you get unexpected bugs
	• It's very important to remember how the Node.js event loop works
		○ Understanding Node.js Basics -> Node.js - Behind the Scenes
	• Here is a code example to show you how to retrive data from a file

		// Model File
		const fs = require('fs');
		const path = require('path');
		const filePath = path.join(
		  path.dirname(process.mainModule.filename),
		  'data',
		  'products.json'
		);
		module.exports = class Product {
		  constructor(title) {
		    this.title = title;
		  }
		  save() {
		    fs.readFile(filePath, (err, fileContent) => {
		      let products = [];
		      if (!err) {
		        products = JSON.parse(fileContent);
		      }
		      products.push(this);
		      fs.writeFile(filePath, JSON.stringify(products), (err) => console.log(err));
		    })
		  }
		  /* - Here we have a static method, meaning it can be called on the object prototype instead of just on an individual object
		     - i.e. Product.fetchAll()
		     - This method accepts a callback so that it works better within the Node.js event loop
		     - Normally, if we just tried returning the value [] or JSON.parse(fileContent), we would receive an error since the callback inside the method would be registered, but run at the wrong time
		     - So, we can establish a callback tree and utilize it in our controller so that we work within the Node.js event loop */
		  static fetchAll(cb) {
		    fs.readFile(filePath, (err, fileContent) => {
		      if (err) {
		        cb([])
		      }
		      cb(JSON.parse(fileContent))
		    })
		  }
		}
		
		// Controller File
		const Product = require("../models/product");
		exports.getAddProduct = (req, res, next) => {
		  res.render('add-product', {
		    pageTitle: 'Add Product',
		    path: '/admin/add-product',
		    formsCSS: true,
		    productCSS: true,
		    activeAddProduct: true
		  })
		}
		exports.postAddProduct = (req, res, next) => {
		  const product = new Product(req.body.title);
		  product.save();
		  res.redirect('/');
		}
		/* - Here, we call that fetchAll() method and pass in our callback function
		   - We "pass" products, but really the product value is being given from the fetchAll method.
		   - This structure makes it so that fetchAll runs, then this middleware runs
		   - Think of it as climbing up the function tree instead of going down
		   - Normally, we create a function that calls a function
		   - Here, we are creating a function that calls back to a function, then uses that callback functions data to create the function we need
		   - Not complicated, just abstract...
		   - This is how all those functions work were we pass an argument but the argument seems to already have data that we didn't supply. The data comes from the function that it's being called from
		   - Climbing up instead of drilling down */
		exports.getProduct = (req, res, next) => {
		  Product.fetchAll((products) => {
		    res.render('shop', {
		      prods: products,
		      pageTitle: 'Shop',
		      path: '/',
		      hasProducts: products.length > 0,
		      activeShop: true,
		      productCSS: true
		    });
		  });
		}
