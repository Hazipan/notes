	• Express will handle a lot of the heavy lifting in our server, such as handling requests, routing, and parsing incoming data
	• It is installed as a thrid party package via npm

What is Express.js?
	• Server side logic is complex and very "nitty gritty"
		○ Express lets us focus on our application rather than on server logic
	• Express can hook into other packages to help make processing incoming data much, much easier
	• There are of course alternatives
		○ vanilla Node.js
		○ Adonis.js
			§ Laravel inspired framwork
		○ Koa
		○ Sails.js
		○ etc.
	• Express is highly flexible and doesn't add a whole lot of functionality, but makes working with server logic much, much easier
		○ There are hundreds of other packages that are made specifically for Express to add funcitonalities, which is another reason Express is so popular

Starting up with Express
	• To get started, install Express via npm
		
		npm i --save express
		
	• Then, import express via a request statement, then we can create an express app with express()
		
		const http= require('http');
		const express = require('express');
		const app = express();
		
		○ The express module exports a function, so we must execute it as a function
		○ Our app variable now has a lot of the Express logic, and it is also a valid handler that can be passed into our http server
		
		const server = http.createServer(app);
		server.listen(3000);
	
		○ We now have a running server, but it can't handle request yet
		○ We can also shorten this and only use our app and omit the http.createServer() funcition
			
		app.listen(3000);
		

Middleware
	• Express is all about middleware
		○ Middleware allows us to break up our server logic functions
		○ Incoming request -> middleware -> next() -> more middle ware -> res.send() - Response sent
	• This is why Express has so many plugin packages, because most of those packages are middleware
	• To create middleware, we use the .use() function on our express app
		○ .use() takes a callback with 3 arguments: req, res, and next
			§ We can rename any of them, but req and res is what we know with extra features, but next is a function that is passed inside the callback that lets the request travel to the next middleware
			§ The .use() methods are called from top to bottom, in order, but only if we use the next() function
		○ The .use() method will be called on every request that comes to the server
		
		// Middleware that will be used for every incoming request
		app.use((req, res, next) => {
		  console.log("In the middleware");
		  next(); // Moves to the next middleware function
		});
		
		// Second middleware funciton
		app.use((req, res, next) => {
		  console.log("Different Middleware");
		});
		
		○ If we don't call next, we need to send a response, otherwise the request is stopped and no response is given
	• Sending responses is a lot easier in Express via a new utility function, res.send()
		○ This set our content type header for us to a default of "text/html"
		○ We can override this with the usual res.setHeader() function
		
		res.send("<h1>Hello World</h1>");
		// Sends a response with the html code
		
Handling Routes
	• There are multiple ways to use the .use() function, one way is for routing.
		○ To route, we can add an argument to the beginning of the arguments of the url we want to target
		○ It checks to see if the url starts with the string provided, so '/' will match all urls
		○ So, we add other routes before the middleware that handles the '/' url, so that the '/' routing middleware only runs when we want it to
		
		app.use('/add-product', (req, res, next) => {
		  res.send("<h1>Add Product Page</h1>");
		});
		
		app.use('/', (req, res, next) => {
		  res.set("<h1>Home page</h1>");
		});
		
	• The order of routes is very important, they are seen top-to-bottom

Parsing Incoming Requests
	• To redirect request, we can use the res.redirect() function, which accepts a string of the url to be redirected to
		
		res.redirect("/home");
		
		○ This is much easier than setting headers and status codes ourself
	• To access incoming data, Express gives us an easy way to do it by accessing req.body
		○ However, the request body will not be parsed by default, to parse it we need to register a parser
		○ We will do this by adding another third-party package
		
		npm install --save body-parser
		
		○ This package comes with Express by default, but it has been removed before, so it's good to add it incase it ever gets removed again
	• To use it, we add a it's middleware to the top of our middleware chain
		
		app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
		
		○ This adds middleware that parses data for us, rather than us doing it ourselves
	• With this at the top of our middleware chain, we can access the data in req.body
		○ It returns a JS object with the key-value pairs pulled from the input data
	• Now we need to limit the route to only run when the method is POST
		○ We can filter the methods via app.get() for GET requests and app.post() for POST requests
			§ Using these also make the defined url an exact match rather than just included, unlike app.use()
		○ These work the exact same way as .use() except they filter for the specific method
		
		const express = require('express');
		const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
		const app = express();
		app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
		app.get("/add-product", (req, res) => {
		  res.send("<form action='/product' method='POST'><input type='text' name='title'><button type='submit'>Add Product</button></form>");
		});
		app.post("/product", (req, res) => {
		  console.log(req.body);
		  res.redirect("/");
		})
		app.use('/', (req, res) => {
		  res.send("<h1>Hello Express!</h1>")
		})
		app.listen(3000);
		
The Express Router
	• Typically, we want to spread our routing logic out when our application gets scaled up
		○ To do this, we separate our routes into separate file to keep our code organized and clean
	• With Express, its really easy to create multiple files that contain routing logic
	• To start, we import express, then create a Router object
		
		const express = require("express");
		const router = express.Router();
		
		○ Now we can export the Router and register things to it to link it all into our core app file
		
		// admin.js file
		const express = require("express");
		const router = express.Router();
		
		router.get("/add-product", (req, res) => {
		  res.send("<form action='/product' method='POST'><input type='text' name='title'><button type='submit'>Add Product</button></form>");
		});
		router.post("/product", (req, res) => {
		  console.log(req.body);
		  res.redirect("/");
		})
		
		module.exports = Router;
		
		○ From here, router is now a vaild middleware function once imported
		
		const route = require("./routes/route");
		app.use(route);
		
	• Putting it together:
		
		// app.js
		
		const express = require('express');
		const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
		
		const adminRoutes = require("./routes/admin");
		const shopRoutes = require("./routes/shop");
		const app = express();
		
		app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
		
		app.use(adminRoutes);
		app.use(shopRoutes);
		
		app.listen(3000);
		
		// routes folder
		// admin.js
		
		const express = require("express");
		const router = express.Router();
		
		router.get("/add-product", (req, res) => {
		  res.send("<form action='/product' method='POST'><input type='text' name='title'><button type='submit'>Add Product</button></form>");
		});
		router.post("/product", (req, res) => {
		  console.log(req.body);
		  res.redirect("/");
		})
		module.exports = router;
		
		// shop.js
		
		const express = require("express");
		const router = express.Router();
		router.get('/', (req, res) => {
		  res.send("<h1>Hello Express!</h1>")
		})
		module.exports = router;
		
Adding a 404 page
	• To catch any unrouted pages, we add a catch all to the bottom of our middleware stack of our application
		
		app.use((req, res, next) => {
		  res.status(404).send(<h1>404: Page not Found</h1>);
		});
		
		○ Notice how we chained the response methods together
			§ We can do that for all response methods as long as .send() is last
			
Filtering Routes
	• If we have multiple pages that share common url pieces, we can filter through them and avoid typing the same thing over and over
		○ i.e. "/users/hazipan" and "/users/ddnpr53"
	• To filter the "/users" part out, we can remove it form the url string argument in the routing code, then when we import the files, we can use "/users" to filter
		
		const userRouting = require("./routing/users");
		app.use("/users", userRouting);
		
		○ Now it will ignore the /users part of the url when we are routing within the users.js file

Serving HTML Files
	• So far, we've used .send() to send html snippets, but we can send entire HTML files via .sendFile()
		
		router.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
		  res.sendFile('/absolutePathToFile.html');
		})
		
		○ The path that you pass to .sendFile() must be absolute, and to get a path like "/views/main.html" to work, we have to use the path core module, and use the .join() method
		
		const path = require("path")
		
		router.get('/', (req, res, nex) => {
		  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'file.html'));
		});
		
		○ The __dirname variable is a global variable that stores the absolute path of our current file, then we separate the pieces of the path into separate arguments, that way that path can be properly constructed if the server is run on linux or window
			§ Linux use "/" in the path names
			§ Windows uses "\" in the path names
		○ If we wanted to access a neighboring folder from the routing logic to access the file we want to serve, we can include a ".." argument, to get the path to go up one level in our directory, then access folders outside of where the path is constructed
		
		res.sendFile(__dirname, '..', 'siblingFolder', 'myFile.html');
		
	•  We can also store the root folder of our server, store it in a file, then import it and use it across all of our files
		○ This way we don't have to use __dirname and the '..' arugment to navigate up our directory tree
		○ Mainly helps our code look cleaner
		
		// root.js
		const path = require('path');
		module.exports = path.dirname(require.main.filename);
		
Serving Files Statically
	• By convention, all static files that are available without permissions are stored in a file called public
	• Normally, the plain files inside our server directory are not available to the client, we give them exactly what we think is necessary
		○ To get CSS and other static assets to be accessible, we have to give read permission to the client
		○ This is done via the express.static() method
			§ It accepts a path to the folder you want to make available
			
		app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
		
		○ Once the static files are made available, we can access them without directing to the public folder, we can just act as if public is the root of our file tree
		
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main.css">
		
	• You can set up multiple public folders by reusing the express.static() syntax
