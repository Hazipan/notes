Review of Essential JavaScript Concepts for Node.js
Asynchronous Concepts
	• When developing with Node.js and JavaScript, we use a mix of synchronus code (blocking I/O) and asynchronous (non-blocking I/O).
Promises
	• A Promise is a JavaScript object that represents the eventual outcome of an asynchronous operation
		○ It has 3 outcomes:
			1. Pending - the result is undefined and the expressiong is waiting for a result
			2. Fulfilled - the promise has been compelted successfully and returned a vlue
			3. Rejected - the promise did not successfully complete, the result is an error object
	• Let’s take a quick look at how to define a promise is defined and how to use it
	
		// Creating a new Promise and saving it to the testLuck variable. Two arguments are being passed, one for when the promise resolves, and one for if the promise gets rejected.
		const testLuck = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
		  if (Math.random() < 0.5) { 
		    resolve('Lucky winner!')
		  } else {
		    reject(new Error('Unlucky!'))
		  }
		});
		 
		testLuck.then(message => {
		  console.log(message) // Log the resolved value of the Promise
		}).catch(error => {
		  console.error(error) // Log the rejected error of the Promise
		});
		
Async/Await
	• The async…await syntax allows developers to easily implement Promise-based code
		○ The keyword async used in conjunction with a function declaration creates an async function that returns a Promise
		○ Async functions allow us to use the keyword await to block the event loop until a given Promise resolves or rejects
			§ The await keyword also allows us to assign the resolved value of a Promise to a variable
		
		// Creating a new promise that runs the function in the setTimeout after 5 seconds. 
		const newPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
		  setTimeout(() => resolve("All done!"), 5000);
		});
		 
		// Creating an asynchronous function using an arrow expression and saving it to a the variable asyncFunction. 
		const asyncFunction = async () => {
		  // Awaiting the promise to resolve and saving the result to the variable finalResult.
		  const finalResult = await newPromise;
		 
		  // Logging the result of the promise to the console
		  console.log(finalResult); // Output: All done!
		}
		 
		asyncFunction();
		
setInterval() and setTimeout()
	• The setInterval() function executes a code block at a specified interval
		○ It takes 2 argumetns:
			1. The code to be executed
			2. The frequency to execute the code in milliseconds
		
		// Defining a function that instantiates setInterval
		const showAlert = () => {
		  // Calling setInterval() and passing a function that shows an alert every 5 seconds.
		  setInterval(() => {
		    alert('I show every 5 seconds!')
		  }, 5000);
		};
		 
		// Calling the newInterval() function that calls the setInterval
		showAlert();
		
	• The setTimeout() function executes a code block after a spcified amount of time
		○ It takes 2 arguments:
			1. The cde to be executed
			2. The delay in miliseconds
		
		// Defining a function that calls setTimeout
		const showTimeout = () => {
		  // Calling setTimeout() that passes a function that shows an alert after 5 seconds.
		  setTimeout(() => {
		    alert('I only show once after 5 seconds!');
		  }, 5000);
		};
		 
		// Calling the showTimeout() function
		showTimeout();
