What are Modules?
	• Modules are reusable pieces of code in a file that can be exported and then imported for use in another file
		○ A modular program is one whose components can be separated, used individually, and recombined to create complex systems
	• The modular strategy is sometimes called separation of concerns and is useful for several reasons
		○ Find, fix, and debug code more easily
		○ Reuse and recycle defined logic in different parts of your application
		○ Keep informatin private and protected from other modules
		○ Prevent pollution of the global namespace and potential naming collisions by cuatiously selecting variables and behavior we load into a program

Implementing Modules: Node.js vs ES6
	• There are multiple ways of implementing modules, depending ont the runtime environment where your code is executed
		○ The Node runtime environment uses the module.exports and require() syntax
		○ The browser's runtime environment uses import/export syntax
	• Since this section of notes is all about Node.js, we will focus on module.exports and require syntax

Implementing Modules in Node
	• Every file that runs in a Node environment is treated as a distinct module
		○ The functions a data defined in each module can be used by any other module, as long as those resources are properly exported and imported
module.exports
	• To create a module, you simply make a new file with the functions to be exported, then add what you want to exports as properties to the built-in module.exports object:
		
		/* converters.js */
		function celsiusToFahrenheit(celsius) {
		  return celsius * (9/5) + 32;
		}
		 
		module.exports.celsiusToFahrenheit = celsiusToFahrenheit;
		 
		module.exports.fahrenheitToCelsius = function(fahrenheit) {
		  return (fahrenheit - 32) * (5/9);
		};
		
		○ The above shows two different ways to export functions from a module
		○ Other files can now import this object, and make use of these two funcitons by using another built-in feature: require()
requrie()
	• The require() funciton accepts a string as an argument, and that string provides the file path to the module you would like to import. Simple as that :)
Object Destructuring to be more Selective
	• In many cases, we will export a large numbe of functions all at once, and when we import, we will only need to use a few of those functions
		○ We can use destructuring to extract only exactly what we need:
		
		const { celsiusToFahrenheit } = require("./converters.js");
