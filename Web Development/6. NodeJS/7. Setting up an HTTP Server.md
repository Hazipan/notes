Intro to HTTP
	• HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a request-response protocol that serves as the foundation of data exchange and communication within the client-server computing model
		○ HTTP helps facilitate the exchange of information between a client and a server
	• The request-response paradigm:
		1. The client submits an HTTP request message to the server
		2. The server receives the HTTP request and performs some function on behalf of the client accoring to the request
		3. The server returns a response message to the client containing important information about the processing of the request
	• To get a look at some HTTP requests, go to webpage, open the developer console, and go the network tab. Refresh the page and you can see all the network HTTP messages that go into building the webpage!

The Structure of HTTP
	• To facilitate the exchange of information between client and severs, HTTPS requests and responses have specific structes
		○ This structure encapsulates all of the important information required to instruct the recipient of the message on how to react
Requests
	• Requests are comprised of a few core elemtns that provide information ot a server
	• Expected core elemnts:
		1. HTTP Method - usually a verb such as GET and POST, or a noun such as OPTIONS and HEAD
			§ These methods inform the server of the intent of the request and are used in accurately routing and processing request
			§ Example: an HTTP request containing the GET method implies that the client wants to fetch a resource
			§ The list of support HTTP methods can be found using the http.METHODS property
		2. Path - The path denotes the path of the resource relative to the root URL
			§ A GET request to https://codecademy.com/api/lessons would strip common elements such as the protocol (https://) and domain (codecademy.com) and leave the path of /api/lessons
		3. HTTP Protocol Version - The verson of the HTTP protocol (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTPS/3)
		4. Headers - Headers are optional and are used to convey additional information that may be important in processing a request by a server
			§ There is an extensive list of standard headers that can be used, as well as custom headers that can be added on a per-applicatin basis
		5. Body - The body contains data required to be sent to the server to process a request
			§ The body is not leveraged for all request types
			§ It is mst common to see a body attached to requests with verbs like POST, PUT, and PATCH
Responses
	• Responses are comprised of similar elements to their counterpart requests, with a few differences
	• Expected core elements:
		1. HTTP Protocol Version - the vertion of the HTTP protocol, similar to the request
		2. Status Code - the status code indicates if the request was successful and, if not, why it wasn't successful
		3. Headers - Similar to request headers
		4. Body - The body of a response contains data corresponding to the fetched resource
			§ The body is optional and contains data only when necessary to fulfill the request

The Movement of HTTP
	• HTTP requests/responses contian all the information needed to communciate with other entities on the web efficiently, but how do these messages get to their destinations?
		○ Just as a letter requires a carrier to arrive, so does an HTTP reqest
		○ The carrier for HTTP is a trasnport protocol
	• There's a lot of transport protocols that exist, but we'll look at the common ones that HTTP leverages to move around the web
TCP
	• TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is the most common transport protocol that is used with HTTP
		○ TCP allows two hosts to connect and exchange data streams, guaranteeing the delivery of data packets in the same order as theywere sent
		○ That means that TCP ensures that packets are delivered reliably and free from error, positioning itself as an incredibly stable way to move data from one location to the other
UDP
	• UDP (User Datagram Protcol) is a less commonly used transport protocol
	• It operates using a connectionless communication model, requirin gno "handshaking", which potentially can lead to inreliability in the deliver of messages
		○ UDP has no mechanism by which to gurantee delivery or ordering of messages
	• While that is a drawback for some applications, other applications want to prioritize transmission speed and efficiency over security and reliablity, so they leverage UDP
---
	• While these transport protocols are greate for moving requests to where they need to go, they lack any meaningful security to protect the data while in transit
		○ To remedy this, encryption protocols are commonly used
TLS
	• TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a widely adopted security protocol designed to facilitate secure data transmissions via encryption
	• TLS evolved out of the encryption protocol known as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) which as since been deprecated in favor of TLS
		○ Thile these two are different, the terms are sometiems used interchangeably
	• Using TLS with HTTP allows you to use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) which helps denot the presence of the extra security
---
	• In addition to the different transport protocols, there are also different versions of HTTP
		○ These distinct versions at a baseline operate similarly in that they carry information between entities and maintain important distincitons
HTTP/1.1
	• HTTP/1.1 was one of the first versions of HTTP protocol to be designed and implemented
	• It operates by sending messages in the form of text
	• HTPPS/1.1 is commonly used over TCP and is the slowest of the HTTP version regarding data transmission
HTTP/2
	• HTTP/2 is a major revision of HTTP/1.1 and was developed with the intent ot try and reduce web page load latency
	• The most significant difference between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 is the encapsulation of all messages in binary format rather than plain text
		○ This allows HTTP/2 to apply different techniques for data transmission, including sending smaller packets of data for greater flexibility of data transfer
		○ This also allows a single connection to be made between two communicating entities rather than multiple
	• HTTP/2 also leverages TCP for transport
HTTP/3
	• HTTP/3 is the thrid major version of HTTP
	• There's a lot of complex difference between it and previous version, but one of the most important is how the protocol deals with lost packets
	• HTTP/3 also differs through its use of transport protocol
		○ It uses a protocol called QUIC, which applies specific controls of UDP
	• HTTP/3 is currently an Internet Draft

The HTTP Module
	• To process HTTP requests in JS and Node, we can use the built-in http module
		○ This core module is key in leveraging Node networking and is extremely useful in creating HTTP servers and processing HTTP requests
	• The http module come with lots of useful methods for engaging with HTTP network requests
		○ One of the most commonly used methods is the .createServer() method
		
		const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
		  res.end("Server is running!");
		});
		
		server.listen(8080, () => {
		  const { address, port } = server.address();
		  console.log(`Server is listening on: https:// ${address}:${port}`);
		});
		
		○ The .createServer() method takes a single argument in the form of a callback function
			§ This callback function has two primary arguments, the request (req) and the response (res)
	• The req object contains all of the information about an HTTP request ingested by the server
		○ It exposes information such as the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.), the pathname, headers, body, and so on
		○ The res object contains methods and properties pertaining to the geration of a response by the HTTP server.
		○ This object contains methods such as .setHeader() (sets HTTP headers on the response), .statusCode() (set the status code of the response), and .end() (dispatches the response to the client who made the request)
		○ In the above example, we use the .end() method to send the string "Server is Running!" to the client, shich will display on the web page
	• Once the .createServer() method has instantiated the server, it must begin listening for connections. The final step is accomplished by the .listen() method on ther server instance
		○ This method takes a port number as the first argument, which telss the server to listen for connections at the given port number
		○ In the example above, the server has been set to listen on port 8080
		○ Additionally, the .listen() method takes an optional callback funciton as a second argument, allowing it to carry out a task after the server has successfully started
	• Using the .createServer() method, in conjunction with the callback, provides the ability to process HTTP requests dynamically and dispatch responses back to their callers

Anatomy of a URL
	• HTTP servers have to break down requestes into parts to effectively process them and provide adequate responses
		○ In the same vein, designing an API (Application Programming Interface) with endpoints intended to process specific requests in certain ways requires understanding the semantics of these requests, which ultimately embodied within a URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
	• A URL can provide a great deal of information about a request and how it is expected to behave
	• A URL has 4 parts:
		1. Protocol - The protocol of the URL denotes what protocol is being used for this particular resource. A URL could have HTTP or HTTPS
		2. Domain - The domain of the URL is a unique reference that identifies a website on the Internet
		3. Path - The path refers to a file or directory on the web server. Paths regularly contain path parameters that APIs can process as a way to provide additional data when processing
		4. Query - The query is commonly found on pages that contain dynamic content. They are prefixed by a ? and appear at the end of a URL. Queries can be comprised of multiple key/value pairs, separated by a &, with each key being assigne dits corresponding value us a =. Queries are used in conjuction with GET requests to pass filter parameters in order to provide specificity for the requested resource

The URL Module
	• Usually, an HTTP server will require information from the request URL to accurately process a request
		○ This request URL is located on the url property within the req object itself
		○ To parse the different parts of a URL, Node provides the built-in url module
			§ It revolves around the URL class
			
		const url = new URL("https: //www.example.com/p/a/t/h?query=string");
		
	• Once instantiated, different parts of the URL can be access and modified via properties
		○ hostname - gets and sets the host name portion of the URL
		○ pathname - gets and sets the path portion of the url
		○ serchParams - gets the search parameter object representing the query parameters contained within the URL. Returns an instance of the URLSearchParams class
		
		const host = url.hostname; // example.com
		const pathname = url.pathname; // /p/a/t/h
		const searchParams; // {query: "string"}
	
	• The can event construct a URL using these properties
		
		const createdUrl = new URL("https://www.example.com");
		createdUrl.pathname = "/p/a/t/h";
		createdUrl.search = "?query=string";
		
		createdUrl.toString(); // https: //www.example.com/p/a/t/h?query=string
		
The Querystring Module
	• Another way we can handle query strings is to use the built-in querystring module
		○ The querystring module is dedicated to providing utilities soley focused on parsing and formatting URL query strings, so it provides a small number of methods to use:
		○ .parse() - parses a URL query string into a collection of key-value pairs
			§ The .decode() method does the same thing
		○ .stringify() - Produces a URL query string from a given object via iteration
			§ The .encode() method does the same thing
		○ .escape() - This method is used for performing percent-encoding on given query string
		○ .unescape() - Used to decode percent-encoded characters withing a given query string
	• In the latest versons of Node (v16.x) the queryString module has become a legacy feature, and its core functionality has been absorbed into the url module via the URLSearchParams API
		○ querystring is still handy to know if you use older version of Node

Routing
	• Servers need a way to handle each request based on specific citeria like method, pathname, etc.
		○ Handling requests in specific ways based on the information provided is known a routing
	• Since each HTTP request contains a method such as GET and POST, they are a great way to discern different classes of requests based on the action intended for the server tocarry out
		○ All GET requests can be routed to a specific funciton for handling and all POST requests can be routed to another function
		○ This allows for the logical co-location of processing code with specific verb to be handled
		
		const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
		  const { method } = req;
		
		  switch(method) {
		    case "GET":
		      return "handleGetRequest(req, res);
		    case "POST":
		      return handlePostRequest(req, res);
		    case "DELETE":
		      return handleDeleteRequest(req, res);
		    case "PUT":
		      return handlePutRequest(req, res);
		    default:
		      throw new Error(`Unsupported request method: ${method}`);
		  }
		})
		
	• The above function routes various methods to their corresponding functions, but how do we distinguish one GET request (or other methods) from another
		○ We can distinguish on request from another of the same method through the pathname
		○ The pathname allows the server to understand what resource is being targeted
		
		const handleGetRequest(req, res) {
		  const { pathname } = req.url;
		  let data = {};
		
		  if (pathname === "/projects") {
		    data = await getProjects();
		    res.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
		    return res.end(JSON.stringify(data));
		  }
		
		  res.statusCode = 404;
		  return res.end("Requested resource does not exist");
		}
		
HTTP Status Codes
	• Once a request is processed, a response must be returned to the client to inform it of what happened
		○ To build a response, several pieces of information are required, on of which is the HTTP response status code, which is responsible for indicating whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed
	• There are 5 classes of response status codes:
		1. Informational (100 - 199)
		2. Successful (200 - 299)
		3. Redirects (300 - 399)
		4. Client Errors (400 - 499)
		5. Server Errors (500 - 599)
	• Each response status code conveys information about what happened during the processing of the request, which helps the clients decide how to handle the response and if further action is necessary
		○ Status codes are paired with ashort text-based description to help explain the meaning of the code
		○ i.e.: "200 OK", "400 Bad Request", and "500 Internal Server Error"
	• https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status

Interacting with a Database
	• In real world, servers are responsible for helping persist and retrieve data and that is usally done by interacting with a  database
	• Databases are remote resource that servers make requests to via HTTP messages
		○ Databases have their own Software Development Kits (SDKs) and Object-Relational Mapping (ORMs) that can be used to connect to them easilyt
		○ But, with the right information, requests could potentially be made in a raw form directly from your server using something like the HTTP .request() method
	• A single server isn't always the final destination when processing a request
		○ Instead, a client send a request, which is then processed partially, generating a separate HTTP request from the server to the database
		○ Once received, the server waits for the database's response and will ultimately relay that information as a response back tot eh original caller
		
		 
		const http = require('http');
		const fs = require('fs');
		
		// GET request handler
		const handleGetRequest = (req, res) => {
		 if (req.url === '/users') {
		   // Loads the database and searches for data
		   makeDatabaseRequest('users', (err, payload) => {
		      if (err) {
		        res.writeHeader(400);
		        res.write("Error retrieving data");
		      } else {
		        // Process successful request
		        console.log(payload)
		        res.writeHeader(200, {"Content-Type": "application/json"});  
		        res.write(JSON.stringify(payload));
		      }
		      res.end(); 
		   });
		 }
		}
		
		// Creates server instance
		const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
		  const { method } = req;
		 
		  switch(method) {
		    case 'GET':
		      return handleGetRequest(req, res);
		    default:
		      throw new Error(`Unsupported request method: ${method}`);
		  }
		});
		
		// Starts server listening on specified port
		server.listen(4001, () => {
		  const { address, port } = server.address();
		  console.log(`Server is listening on: http:// ${address}:${port}`);
		});
		
		function makeDatabaseRequest(type, cb) {
		  fs.readFile('./database.json', 'utf8', function (err, payload) {
		    if (err) {
		      cb(err, null); 
		    } else {
		      cb(null, JSON.parse(payload)[type]);
		    }
		  });
		}
		
Interacting with Another Backend API
	• Just like with databases, sometimes servers need to make requests to external APIs to accomplish some goal
		○ Some common situations for this are payment processing, serviece integrations with other products, webhooks, and more
	• There's a few methods provided by the http module that facilitate making HTTP requests to external services, such as the request() method
		○ The request() method takes to arguments
			1. A configuration object containing details about the reqest
			2. A callback to halde the response
	
		const options = {
  hostname: 'example.com',
		  pott: 8080,
		  pathname: '/projects',
		  method: 'GET',
		  headers: {
		    'Content-Type': "application/json"
		  }
		}
		
		const request = http.request(options, res => {
		  // handle the response here
		})
		
	• The http module provides a convenient method for making GET requests in the form of the get() method
		○ This method is different from the request() method in that it automatically sets the method to GET and calls req.end()
	• Servers being able to make HTTP requests to other services opens up possibilites for different architecture designs for back-end
		○ One example of an architecture made possible by this is microservice architectures
			§ Microservice architectures divide needs into separate lightweight services that communicate via HTTP over a network
			§ As such, a single application can be comprised f dozens of microservices, which could all be written in a different programming language, but work together by communicating over HTTP
