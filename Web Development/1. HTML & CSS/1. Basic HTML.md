# HTML Syntax

HTML elements are simple objects, such as headers, lists, and body elements.

Tags indicate the opening and end of an element. As a convention, all tags are lower case.

- Opening tags: `<element>`
- Closing tags: `</element>`

## Headers and Paragraphs

To create headers, we use header tags. Headers range from numbers 1 through 6 (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6) and are used to structure our content.

- Opening tag: `<h1>`
- Closing tag: `</h1>`

The `<p>` element is used to create paragraphs

```HTML
<p>Insert paragraph!</p>
```

## Comments

You can comment out code by opening with `<!--` and ending with `-->`

```HTML
<!--
    <h1>Commented Heading</h1>
    <p>Commented paragraph.</p>
-->
```

# General HTML Structure

There are a few elements that give overall structure to your page and should be included in every HTML document. At the top of your document (the first line) you need to tell your browser which version of HTML your page is using, and you do this by including the `<!DOCTYPE [type]` tag. For HTML5 (the latest form of HTML) the type is set to `html`.

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

Next, the rest of your page must be wrapped in `<html>` tags

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    …web page code…
</html>
```

You need section out your page further by using the `<head>` and `<body>` tags. Any markup information about your page would go in the head section of an HTML document. This includes metadata, links to stylesheets and website scripts, and more. Any markup for the content of the page (what is displayed for the user) would go into the body tag.

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta />
    </head>
        
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <div></div>
    </body>
</html> 
```

# Semantic HTML

HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags, such as main, header, footer, nav, video, article, section, and more. These help describe and give structure to our code, making our HTML easier to read and helps with Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

```HTML
<main>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>Hello Paragraph</p>
</main>
```

HTML5 tags and their benefits are covered in more detail in the Applied Accessibility section.

# Images

Images can be added by using the `<img>` element and using the `src` attribute to point to an images URL.

```HTML
<img src="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/your-image.jpg">
```

Image elements are self closing (they have no opening and closing tags, just one tag). All `<img>` elements should have an `alt` attribute. The text in the `alt` attribute is used for screen readers and is displayed if the image fails to load. If the image is purely decorative, it is best practice to use an empty alt attribute.

```HTML
<img src="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/your-image.jpg" alt="A business cat wearing a necktie.">
```

# Anchors (Links)

The `<a>` (anchor) element is used to link to content outside of your web page. `<a>` elements need a destination web address called an `href` attribute. They also need anchor text, which is placed between the opening and closing tags

```HTML
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org>this links to freecodecamp.org</a>
```

"This links to freecodecamp.org" will be displayed and it will link to the freecodecamp website. Like this: [This links to freecodecamp.org](/C:/Users/ruthe/AppData/Local/Programs/Joplin/resources/app.asar/freecodecamp.org "freecodecamp.org")

The `<a>` element can also be used to create internal links to jump to various sections within a page. You'll need to assign a link's `href` attribute to a `#` plus the id of attribute of the element you want to link to. Any element can have an id attribute, but any elements with an id should have a completely unique id.

```HTML
<a href="#contacts-header">Contacts</a>
…
<h2 id="contacts-header">Contacts</h2>
```

You can also nest links within other text elements

```HTML
<p>
    Here's a <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org"> link to www.freecodecamp.org</a> for you to follow
</p>
```

You can also use the `target` attribute to specify where to open the link. `_blank` specifies to open in a new tab.

Placing just a # in an href attribute creats a dead link, which can be useful for creating a link even when you're not sure where it's going yet. You can also use an img element in place of the text to turn an image into a link

```HTML
<a href="#">
    <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" alt="Three kittens running towards the camera.">
</a>
```

# Lists

Unordered lists (bulleted) are created through the `<ul>` element with nested `<li>` elements. Ordered lists (numbered) are created in the same way, but with the `<ol>` element instead of the `<ul>` element.

```HTML
<ul>
    <li>milk</li>
    <li>cheese</li>
</ul>
```

# Input and Forms

## Input

You can get user input via the `<input>` element, which is self-closing, like the `<img>` element. The `type` attribute specifies the type of input that is accepted, and also changes how the element looks on the page. See a full list of input types [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp).

```HTML
<input type="text">
```

You can add placeholder text via the `placeholder` attribute. This attribute only works on input types where the user can type in a box, such as `text` or `number` inputs

```HTML
<input type="text" placeholder="this is placeholder text">
```

## Labels

All `<input>` elements should be linked to a `<label>` element. You can do this by either (1) nesting the `<input>` into the the `<label>` or (2) defining a `for` attribute in the label and setting it equal to the id of the `<input>`. It is best practice to use the `for` attribute when using `<label>` elements. It allows assistive technologies to create a linked relationship between the label and the related input element.

```HTML
<label>I'm a label
    <input type="text" placeholder="Fill me in">
</label
```

```HTML
<label for="my-input">I'm a label</label>
<input id="my-input" type="text" placeholder="Fill me in">
```

## Requiring Data

You can mark a field required by using the `required` attribute in an `<input>` element

```HTML
<input type="text" placeholder="First Name" required>
```

## Radio Buttons

You can create radio buttons by setting the input `type` attribute to `radio`. You can group related radio buttons by giving them all the same `name` attribute. By creating a radio group, selecting any single radio button will automatically deselect the other buttons within the same group ensuring only one answer is provided by the user.

```HTML
<input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" id="indoor"> 
<label for="indoor">Indoor</label>

<input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" id="outdoor"> 
<label for="outdoor">Outdoor</label>
```

## Checkboxes

Checkboxes are another type of input that we create by setting the `type` attribute to `checkbox`

```HTML
<input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality">
<label for="loving">Loving</label>
```

## Value Attribute

• The `value` attribute is mostly used in radio buttons and check boxes to give actual values to the inputs selected.
○ When a form is submitted, the `value` of the input is recorded (if it's selceted), otherwise the default value of `on` is recorded. So, always give radio buttons and checkboxes a `value`.

```HTML
<input id="indoor" value="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">
<label for="indoor">Indoor</label>

<input id="outdoor" value="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">
<label for="outdoor">Outdoor</label>
```

Once submitted, the value of `indoor-outdoor` will be set to either `indoor` or `outdoor` because the value of each has been set. If removed, the value would be recoreded as `on`, which is not useful.

## Checked by Default

You can use the `checked` attribute in a radio button or checkbox to make them be checked by default

```HTML
<input type="radio" name="test-name" checked>
```

## Submitting Data

You can build web forms that submit data to a sever using the `<form>` element with nested `<input>` elements. You can specify an `action` attribute on a form element to specify the URL path the form submits the data to, and you can also submit the `method` to specify what HTTP method the form should use when submitting its data, but you can only use either `POST` or `GET`.

```HTML
<form action="url-to-submit-data-to" method="POST">
    <input>
</form>
```

To make the form send the data to its action path, you can create a submit button that sends the data filled out in the form. The submit `<button>` element should be nested into the form element, at the end, after any `<input>` elements

```HTML
<button type="submit">This button submits the form</button>
```

# Miscellaneous Tags

## The `<div>` Element

The `<div>` (division) element is a general purpose container for other elements. It's the most common used element of all. It helps organize your code by grouping related elements together and separating them form other blocks of code.

## Break

The `<br>` tag creates a break in the webpage, causing a new line to be started. It can be inserted in the middle of text to make it take more than one line.
