# Image `alt` Text

Make sure you use the `alt` tag when using images. `alt` tags provide alternate text when an image fails to load and they are imperative when the user relies on screen readers. Also, make sure hat the `alt` text is relavent.

```HTML
<img src="[url]" alt="Kitten playing with yarn">
```

If an image is just visual decoration, you should leave the `alt` text blank, but still include the attribute. This includes background images or images that are already explained in text and don't add meaning to the page.

# Heading Tags

When using headings, use them in a way that shows the hierarchical relationship of your content. `h1` through `h6` are 'workhorse' tags that help provide structure and labeling of you content. Screen readers can be set to only read headings so that the user gets a summary of the pages content, so it's important for you headings to have meaning.

It may be tempting to use an alternate heading tag because of how it looks (i.e. `h2` followed by `h4` for looks). ***DO NOT DO THIS***. Instead, style your headings with CSS.

Each page should have one, **only one**, `h1` element, and it should be the main subject of your page.

# Accessibility Tags and How to Use Them

HTML5 gives us access to many tags to help us with accessibility features, such as `main`, `header`, `footer`, `nav`, `article`, `section`, and more. By default, these are all rendered like the `div` element, but when used appropriatly, they give additional meaning to your markup.

The `main` element is used to wrap you main content, and there should only be one per page. It also has embedded landmark technology for assistive technology to use in navigation.

The `article` tag is used to section out content that is independent and self-contained. They work great for blog entries, forum posts, and news articles. Determining whether content can stand alone is a judgment call, just ask yourself, "If you removed the surrounding context, would it still make sense? Would the content hold up if it were in an RSS feed?"

he `section` tag has a slightly different meaning. `article` is for standalone content and `section` is for grouping thematically related content and they can be used together (i.e. if the book is the `article`, the chapter is the `section`). `<div>` groups content, `<section>` groups related content, and `<article>` groups independent, self-contained content.

## Landmark Tags

`<header>` is used to wrap introductory information or navigation links for the parent tag and works well around content that's repeated at the top on multiple pages

The `<nav>` element is meant to wrap around the main navigation links of your page

`<footer>` is used to contain copyright information or links to related documents. This usually sits at the bottom of the page.

## Media Tags

Use `<audio>` tags to wrap sounds and audio stream content in your markup. The `<audio>` tag supports the `controls` attribute that shows the browser default play, pause, and other controls, and supports keyboard functionality. It's a Boolean attribute, if it's present it turns the setting on.

Multimedia content usually has both visual and auditory components. It needs synchronized captions and a transcript so users with visual and/or auditory impairments can access it. Generally, a web developer is not responsible for creating the captions or transcript, but needs to know to include them.

`<figure>` (used in conjunction with `<figcaption>`) is used to wrap items that are visual representations like diagrams and charts along with their caption. The `<figcaption>` tags should be nested inside the figure tags.

# Accessibility in Forms

The `<label>` tag wraps the text for a specific form control item, usually the name or label for a choice. This ties meaning to it and makes the form more readable. The `for` attribute on a label explicitly associates that label with the form control and is used by screen readers

```HTML
<form>
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
</form>
```

`<fieldset>` tags and `<legend>` tags help make radio buttons more accessible. All radio buttons should have a `<label>` with a `for` attribute, but hey should also be grouped together inside `<fieldset>` tags to group them together for screen readers. The `<legend>` tags are placed inside the `<fieldset>` tags to let screen readers know what to do with the grouped buttons.

```HTML
<form>
    <fieldset>
        <legend>Choose one of these three items:</legend>
        <input id="one" type="radio" name="items" value="one">
        <label for="one">Choice One</label><br>
        <input id="two" type="radio" name="items" value="two">
        <label for="two">Choice Two</label><br>
        <input id="three" type="radio" name="items" value="three">
        <label for="three">Choice Three</label>
    </fieldset>
</form>
```

Some form elements, such as the date picker, will default to other elements when seen on older browsers, so be sure to show users in the `label` attribute or the `placeholder` text what the input field is for.

# Time

The `<time>` tags along with the `<datetime>` attribute is used to wrap dates for screen reader accessibility and standardization

```HTML
<p> The event is on <time datetime="2021-01-15">January 15th</time>.</p>
```

# Hiding Elements Meant for Screen Readers

Sometimes we may want to hide certain elements of our page because they will only be needed if a screen reader is being used. We can do this with CSS.

One example:

```CSS
.sr-only {
    position: absolute;
    left: -10000px;
    width: 1px;
    height: 1px;
    top: auto;
    overflow: hidden;
}
```

Setting the visibility to `hidden` or the display to `none` does not accomplish the same thing, because it will cause the information to be hidden from screen readers as well as regular users. Setting zero pixel values (i.e. `width: 0px;`) removes an element from the normal workflow and will cause the screen reader to ignore the element.

# Color Accessibility

Your text and background should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. Ratios of 1:1 are the same color. 21:1 is black and white. There are online tools to find contrast ratios between colors and it helps avoid colorblindness issues.

The last argument in the `hsl()` color function is a very easy way to change contrast between colors.

# Accessible Links

Screen readers have the option to only read links, so make sure the text of your link is important. Avoid having links that only have the text "click here" or "read more".

# Keyboard Accessibility

You can use the `accesskey` attribute to specify shortcut keys for keyboard-only users This includes links, form controls, and buttons

```HTML
<button accesskey="b">Important Button</button>
```

The `tabindex` attribute has three functions relating to keyboard focus. When it's on the tag, it indicates that the element can be focused on. You can give any element this functionality by setting `tabindex` to 0

```HTML
<div tabindex="0">I need keyboard focus!</div>
```

If set to a negative (typically -1) it indicates that the element is focusable but not by the keyboard. This is generally used to bring focus programmatically (like for pop-up windows). `tabindex` also allows the use of the `:focus` pseudo class on the particular element, which similar to `:hover`, but activates on keyboard focus. Setting positive integers to `tabindex` specifies the order that the focus cycles through.
