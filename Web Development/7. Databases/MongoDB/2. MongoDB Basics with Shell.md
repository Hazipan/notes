# Connecting to our database

When connecting to our cloud database, we use a URI string with the following format

```bash
"mongo+srv://user:password@clusterURI.mongodb.net/database"
```

To connect to our database in a shell, we can use the following command

```bash
mongo "mongo+srv://user:password@clusterURI.mongodb.net/database" --username <username>
```

Once connected, we will be in the MongoDB shell, which is a fully functioning JavaScript interpreter and we can interact with our database without a GUI.

# Importing and Exporting data

## Exporting

To expot data as a JSON file, we use the `mongoexport` command

```bash
mongoexport --uri "<Atlas Cluster URI>"
            --colleciton=<collection name>
            --out=<filename>.json
```

To export out data as BSON, we use `mongodump`

```bash
mongodump --uri "<Atals Cluster URI>"
```

## Importing Data

To import via BSON, we navigate to our binary data dumb and use `mongorestore`

```bash
mongorestore --uri "<Atlas Cluster URI>" --drop dump
```

To import JSON data, we use `mongoimport`

```bash
mongoimport --uri "<Atlas Cluster URI>" --drop=<filename>.json
```

The `--drop` parameter drops the database where we specify and replaces it with our imported data and it must be used.

When importing JSON data, we can specify a `--collection` parameter. If we don't define it, then it defaults to the name of the file we are importing.

# Querying in the console

Once we are connected in our console, we can begin querying the database. To see what databases are available, we can use the `show dbs` command. This will show a list of all the databases in the cluster and their size.

To select a specific database, use the `use <database_name>` command. This will connect us to a specific database. Then we can see all the collections in that database with the `show collections` command.

To query a collection of our selected database, we use the `db.<collection_name>.find(<query>)` command.

```bash
db.zips.find( {"state": "NY"} )
```

This will show up to 20 documents. To see the next page of documents, we use the `it` command. The `it` command iterates through the `cursor`. The `cursor` is an object that the find command returns and it is a `pointer` to a result set of a query, which is the direct address of the memory location.

To know how many documents match our query, we can append the `.count()` command to our `.find()` command

```bash
db.zips.find( {"state": "NY" }).count()
```

To make our results more readable, we can use the `.pretty()` directive.

```bash
db.zips.find( {"state": "NY" }).pretty()
```

If we issue the `.find()` command with no query, we recieve 20 documents from the data in no particular order.

We can also get a random, singular document by using the `.findOne()` command. The below code snippet will return one random document that matches our query. We could also pass no query, and just get a radom document. This is greate for getting an idea of the shape of the documents in a specific colleciton.

```bash
db.zips.findOne( {"state": "NY" }).pretty()
```

# Adding Documents

All documents must have a unique `_id`. When you create a document, this field is automatically created with a value that is an `ObjectId` datatype. This is a MongoDB special datatype that ensures a completely unique id is created. However, you can use any value you want, but make sure that it would be unique! The `_id` vied is required for all documents.

To create new documents, we can use the `.insert()` command.

```bash
db.<collection_name>.insert(<document object>)
```

Generally, don't specify an `_id` field, since it will be auto generated for us with a unique `ObjectId` value. 

MongoDB does have schema validation functionality that allows us to enforce a specific document structure, but we won't learn that here.

We can also insert multiple documents at once with `.insert()` and passing an array of documents

```bash
db.<collection_name>.insert([<document object>, <document object>, ...])
```

If you specify a collection that doesn't exist yet, the collection will be created! Same thing if you try to connect to a database that doesn't exist in your cluster. ***So, be careful not to misspell a collection or database name***

# Updating Data

To update documents in the mongo shell, we will use the MQL query language, which is MongoDB's custom query syntax. There are two methods to update documents: `updateOne()` and `updateManu()`. `updateOne()` works like `findOne()` and `updateMany()` works like `find()`.

Both function take two arguments. The first is the query, and the second is the update that needs to happen.

```bash
db.zips.updateMany({"city", "HUDSON", {"$inc": {"pop": 10}}})
```

Here, we used the `$inc` MQL update operator. This tells MongoDB that the specified fields will be increased by the value provided. In this case `pop` is increased by `10` for all documents matching the query `{"city": HUDSON}`. We can change multiple values by separating them with commas.

## Update Operators

- `$inc` increases the field by the value
- `$set` sets the filed to the value
	- Be careful! If you misspell a field and issue an update, the field will be created
- `$push` adds an element to an array field. 

See [all available update operator](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/update/#id1) in the documentation.

The dollar sign has a few uses. It precedes MQL operators and aggregation pipeline stages. It is also used for accessing field values.

# Deleting Documents and Collections

To delete documents, we can use `deleteOne()` and `deleteMany()`, which work similarily to `findOne()` and `find()` as well. `deleteOne()` is only good to use if you are querrying for the specific `_id` to ensure that we delete the correct document. 

To remove a **collection**, we use the `.drop()` function.

```bash
db.<collection_name>.drop()
```

If you remove all collections within a database, the database will be removed as well.

# Comparison Operators

 - `$eq` - equals to
 - `ne` - not equals to
 - `gt` - greater than
 - `lt` - less than
 - `gte` - greater than or equal to
 - `lte` - less than or equal to

All of these are used in queries and use the following syntax:

```
{ <field>: { <operator>: <value> } }
```

# Logic Operators

- `$and`
- `$or`
- `$nor`

```
{<operator: [{statement1}, {statement2},...]}
```

- `$not`

```
{$not: {statement}}
```

The `$and` operator is already present by simply querying multiple field at once. It is *implicit*. The only time you need to explicitly use `$and` is when you are chaining logic operators together.

# Expressive Query Operator

The expressive opperator, `$expr`, allow sthe use of aggregation expressions within the query language. It also lets us use variables and conditional statements.

```
{$expr: {<express>}}
```

We can use the dollar sign (`$`) to access a field to compare values within the same document.

```
{$expr: {$eq: ["$start station name", "$end station name"]}}
```

This will return all documents where the `start station name` and the `end station name` have the same value.

The `$expr` operator uses the Aggregation syntax.

```
{<operator>: {<field>,<value>}}
```

```
{"$expr": {
	"$and": [
		{"$gt": ["$tripduration", 1200]},
		{"$eq": ["$end station id", "$start station id"]}
	]
}}
```

# Array Operator

- `$push` adds an elment to an array and turns a field into an array field it if ws previously a different type.

To query for specific elements within an array field, we can use `$all`. It will return any docmunts that have at least the defind values of the `$all` operator.

```
{<array_field>: {"$all": [<value>, <value>, ...]}}
```

We can use the `$size` operator to filter by exact array length.

```
{<array_field>: {"$size": <number>}}
```
