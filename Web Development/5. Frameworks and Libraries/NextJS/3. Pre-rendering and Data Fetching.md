# Pre-rendering

By default, all pages in Next.js are pre-rendered, meaning that the HTML for each page is generated in advance instead of having to be done by clien-side JavaScript. This generally results in better performance and SEO.

The HTML is shipped with minimal JS. The page is loaded then the JavaScript only adds interactivity (hydration). Plain React.js does not do any pre-rendering.

# Two Types of Pre-rendering

Next.js has two types of pre-rendering. The difference between the two is **when** the HTML for the page is generated.

1. Static Generation pre-renders the HTML at build time. Then the HTML is *reused* on each request.
2. Server-side Rendering is pre-rendering that generates HTML on *each request*.

## Per-page Basis
Next.js allows us to choose what type of pre-rendering we use on a per-page basis, meaning we can create "hybrid" apps that utilize both static generation and server-side rendering.

It's recommended to use static generation whenever possible since the page can be built once and then served by a CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page every single time.

Static generation is great for pages that don't have content that changes. This includes marketing pages, blog posts, e-commerce product listings, and documentation pages. Ask yourself, "Can I render this page ahead of every user request?" If the answer is yes, use static generation.

If you cannot pre-render a page ahead of every user request, use server-side rendering. This is a bit slower, but a great solution for pages that have a lot of changing content or user dependent content.

## Static Generation

Static generation can be done with and without data. When a page doesn't fetch external data, Next.js will automatically use static generation for that page once the app is built for production. However, sometimes you need to access some external data before you render the HTML, such as loading an API or querying a database.

To use static generation with this data, we use `getStaticProps`.  When you export a page component, you can also export an `async` function called `getStaticProps`. If you do this, `getStaticProps` runs at build time in production and you can fetch external data inside the funciton and send it as props to the page.

```JSX
export default function Home(props) { ... }

export async function getStaticProps() {
  // Get external data from the file system, API, DB, etc.
  const data = ...

  // The value of the `props` key will be
  //  passed to the `Home` component
  return {
    props: ...
  }
}
```

Essentially, `getStaticProps` informs Next.js that the page has some external dependancies that it will need to resolve before pre-rendering in production. `getStaticProps` will only ever run on the server, so we can query databases directly or fetch data from external API endpoints without errors.

`getStaticProps` can only be exported from a ***page***. You cannot export it from non-page files.

If you need to fetch data at request time and fetching it before hand would not work, use server-side rendering.

## Server-side Rendering

If we need to fetch data at request time, we can use `getServerSideProps` instead of `getStaticProps`.

```JS
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  return {
    props: {
      // props for your component
    },
  };
}
```

Since `getServerSideProps` is called at request time, its paramter (`context`) contains request specific paramters. You should only use `getServerSideProps` only if you need to pre-render a page whose data must be fetched at request time.

## Client-side Rendering

If you don't need to pre-render the data, you could try to use client-side rendering. Statically generate parts of the page that do not require external data, then when the page loads, fetch external data from the client using JavaScript and populate the remaining parts.

This approach works great for dashboard pages and other private, user-specific pages where SEO is not relevant and the page doesn't need to be pre-rendered. The data is updated frequently, which requires request-time data fetching

### SWR

Next.js has a React hook for data fetching called SWR. It is highly recommended if you're fetching data on the client side. It handles caching, revalidation, focus traking, refetching on interval, and more.

```JS
import useSWR from 'swr';

function Profile() {
  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/user', fetch);

  if (error) return <div>failed to load</div>;
  if (!data) return <div>loading...</div>;
  return <div>hello {data.name}!</div>;
}
```
