# Assets

Next.js can serve static assets from the top-level `'public'` directory. Any files in the folder can be referenced from the root of the application, similar to `'pages'`. It's also a useful sport to store `robots.txt` for Google Site Verification.

## Images

With plain HTML we add images like this:

```HTML
<img src="/images/profile.jpg" alt="Aaron Rutherfrd" />
```

But, we would have to manually handle image responsiveness, optimizing the image, and only loading the image when it enters the viewport. Instead, we can use the Next.js `Image` component to handle all of this for us, out of the box.

By default, Next.js suports image optimization that allows for resizing, optimizing, and serving images in modern formats like WebP when the browser supports it. Now, we won't ship massive images to tiny screens, and it works on any image source, even if the image is hosted by an external data source.

Next.js optimizes images on-demand, as users request them. Images are lazy loaded by default, meaning our page speed ins't penalized for images outside of the view port. They're also rendered in a way to avoid cumulative layout shift.

Here's how we use it:

```JSX
import Image from "next/image";

const YourComponent = () => {
	<Image
		src="/images/profile.jpg" // Route of the image file
		height={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio
		width={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio
		alt="Aaron Rutherford"
	/>
}
```

# Metadata

To modify the data we would normaly include in the HTML `<head>`, we use the `<Head>` component from `next/head`. *Notice the uppercase H.*

```JSX
import Head from "next/head";

...

<Head>
	<title>Create Next App</title>
	<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
</Head>
```

# Third-Pary JavaScript

Third-party JavaScript refers to any scripts that are added form a thrid-party source. Usually, they are added to introduce newer functionality into a site that does not need to be written ourselves like analytics, ads, and customer support widgets.

Normally, we would link the script in our `<Head>` component, but this could significantly impact the performace if the script is render-blocking. Plus, it does not give a clear idea of when it would load with respect to the other JavaScript code fetched on the same page.

Instead, we can use the `Script` component from `next/script`:

```JSX
import Head from "next/head";
import Script from "next/script";
import Link from "next/link";

export default function FirstPost() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>First Post</title>
      </Head>
      <Script
        src="https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js"
        strategy="lazyOnload"
        onLoad={() =>
          console.log(`script loaded correctly, window.FB has been populated`)
        }
      />
      <h1>First Post</h1>
      <h2>
        <Link href="/">
          <a>Back to home</a>
        </Link>
      </h2>
    </>
  );
}
```

Notice that we can give a few additional properties to our `Script` component.

- `strategy` controls when the script should load. The value `lazyOnload` tells Next.js to load the script lazily during browser idle time
- `onLoad` is used to run any JavaScript code immediately after the script has finished loading. Here, we just logged a message to the console.

# CSS Styling

We can create CSS modules to import CSS files in react components. To do this we create a CSS file with the extension `.module.css`, and we define some classes inside the file.

```CSS
/* layout.module.css */
.container {
	max-width: 36rem;
	padding: 0 1rem;
	margin: 3rem auto 6rem;
}
```

From here, we can import this file as a variable, the use it `className` values.

```JSX
import styles from "./layout.module.css";

...

<div className={styles.container}></div>
```

This will apply the `.container` class to our `<div>` element and generate a unique class name to prevent accidental overlap from other CSS aspects in other components and we don't have to worry about class name collisions.

Also, Next.js's code splitting features work with CSS Modules to ensure that the minimal amount of CSS is loaded for each page.

# Global Styles

CSS Modules are greate for component-level styling, but if we want to have gloabl CSS that every page uses, we'll need to create a `pages/_app.js` file with the follwoing content:

```JSX
export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}
```

==**Note: You'll need to restart the development server once you create this file**==

Now, you can add global CSS by importing them in `pages/_app.js`. You cannot import global CSS anywhere else, or you will get an error. We can give our global CSS files any name and store them anywhere, as long as they only get imported from `pages/_app.js`.

To import the CSS file, just use the `import` keyword without the `from` keyword

```JSX
import "../styles/global.css";
```

# Styling Tips

## `classnames`

Use `classnames` to toggle classes. `classnames` is a simple library that lets you toggle class names easily.

```bash
npm i classnames
```
Look at the [classnames documentation](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames) for basic usage.

## Customizing PostCSS Config

Out of the box, Next.js compiles CSS using PostCSS, which means we can create a top-level file named `postcss.config.js` to configure our project to use libraries like Tailwind CSS.

See the [PostCSS documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/customizing-postcss-config) for details.

## Using Sass

Out of the box, Next.js allows you to import Sass using both `.scss` and `.sass` extensions. You can also use component-level Sass via CSS modules by using `.module.scss` or `.module.sass` extensions.
