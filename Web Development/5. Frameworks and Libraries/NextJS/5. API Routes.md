# Creating API Routes

API Routes let you create API endpoints inside a Next.js app. You do so by creating a funciton inside the `page/api` directory that has the following format:

```JS
// req = HTTP incoming message, res = HTTP server response
export default function handler(req, res) {
  // ...
}
```

They can be deployed as Serverless Functions

# API Routes Details

***Do not fetch an API Route from `getStaticProps` or `getStaticPaths`***

Instead, write your server0side code directly in `getStaticProps` or `getStaticPaths` or call a helper function. These funciton only run on the server-side and will never be included in the JS bundle for the browser. 

Read [Writing Server-Side code](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props#write-server-side-code-directly) for more.

## A Good Use Case: Handling Form Input

A good use case for using API Routes is handling form input. You can create a form on your page and have it send a `POST` request to your API route. You can then write code to directly save it to your database. The API Route code will not be part of your client bundle, so you can safely write server-side code

```JS
export default function handler(req, res) {
  const email = req.body.email;
  // Then save email to your database, etc...
}
```

# Dynamic API Routes

API routes can also be dynamic. See the [Dynaimc API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/dynamic-api-routes) documentation.
