	• Redux is a state management framework that can be used with a number of different web technologies, including React

Redux Store
	• In Redux, there is one state object that is reponsible for the entire state of your application
		○ That means if you have a React app with 10 components, each with its own local state, the entire state of the app would be defined by a single state object housed in the Redux store
		○ First important principle of Redux: the Redux store is the single source of truth when it comes to application state
	• Anytime a piece of the app wants to update state, it must do it through the Redux store
		○ This creates a unidirectional data flow that makes it much easier to track state management in the app
		
		/* The createStore() method from the Redux object is what is used to create the Redux store
		The createStore() method requires a reducer function as an argument
		This will be covered later */
		const reducer = (state = 5) => {
		  // reducer uses ES6 default argument parameters to set state to 5 automatically
		  return state;
		}
		
		const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);
		
	• To get state from a Redux store, we use the getState method
		
		const store = Redux.createStore(
		  (state = 5) => state
		);
		// Initialized store with the reducer function in the parameter
		
		const currentState = store.getState();
		
Redux Actions
Defining an Action
	• Updating state is a core task of Redux, and all state updates are triggered by dispatching actions
		○ An action is simply a JS object that contains information about an action event that has occurred
		○ The Redux store receives these action objects, then updates its state accordingly
		○ Redux actions also carry some data
			§ i.e. the action carries a username after a user logs in
			§ Data is optional, but all actions must carry a type property that specifies the type of action that occurred
	• Redux action are messengers that deliver information about events happening in your app to the Redux store. The store then conducts the business of updating state based on the action that occurred
		○ Defining an action is as simple as declaring an object with a type property
		
		const action = {type: 'LOGIN'}

Defining an Action Creator
	• Once an action is defined, the next step is to send it to the Redux store so that it can update its state
		○ In redux, you define action creators to accomplish this
		○ An action creator is simply a JS function that returns an action
		○ Action creators create objects that represent action events
		
		// Action
		const action = {type: 'LOGIN'};
// Aciton Creator
		const actionCreator = () => action;
		
Dispatch an Action Event
	• The dispatch method is what you use to dispatch actions to the Redux store
		○ Calling store.dispatch() and assing the value returned from an action creator sends an action back to the store
		
		// Store initialization
		const store = Redux.createStore(
		  (state = {login: false}) => state
		);
		
		// Action creator
		const loginAction = () => {
		  return {
		    type: 'LOGIN'
		  }
		};
		
		// Dispatch the action
		store.dispatch(loginAction());
		
Handle an Action in the Store
	• Once an action is created and dispatched, the Redux store needs to know how to respond to that action
		○ This is the job of a reducer function
	• Reducers in Redux are responsible for the state modifications that take place in response to actions
		○ A reducer takes state and action as arguments, and it always returns a new state
		○ It is important that this is the only role of the reducer
			§ It doesn't have side effects
			§ It never calls an API endpoint
			§ No hidden surprises
			§ Just a pure function
	• Another key principle in Redux is that state is read-only
		○ The reducer must always return a new copy of state and never modify state directly
			§ Redux doesn't enforce this, you are responsible to enforce it in code
			
		const defaultState = {
		  login: false
		};
		
		/* Reducer function to handle action.
		If it recieves a 'LOGIN' action, it sets the login state to true.
		Otherwise it returns the current state */
		const reducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
		  if(action.type == 'LOGIN') {
		    state = {
		      login: true
		    };
		  }
		
		  return state;
		};
		
		// creation of Redux store with reducer passed as argument
		const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);
		
		// action definition and creator
		const loginAction = () => {
		  return {
		    type: 'LOGIN'
		  }
		};
		
	• You can handle multiple actions using switch statements
		○ i.e. you have a state that represents when users are logged in and logged out. You represent that with a single state object with the property authenticated. We need action creators that create actions corresponding to user login and user logout, along with the action objects themselves
		
		const LOGIN = 'LOGIN';
		const LOGOUT = 'LOGOUT'
		
		const defaultState = {
		  authenticated: false
		};
		
		const authReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
		  // Switch statement to handle both 'LOGIN' and 'LOGOUT' actions
		  switch(action.type) {
		    case LOGIN:
		      state = {
		        authenticated: true
		      };
		      break;
		    case LOGOUT:
		      state = {
		        authenticated: false
		      };
		      break;
		    // Defaults to retrun current state because if we have multiple reducers, they all run at the same time, even if the action isn't related
		    default:
		      return state;
		  }
		
		  return state;
		};
		
		// Redux store creation with reducer passed as argument
		const store = Redux.createStore(authReducer);
		
		// 'LOGIN' action and creator
		const loginUser = () => {
		  return {
		    type: LOGIN
		  }
		};
		
		// 'LOGOUT' action and creator
		const logoutUser = () => {
		  return {
		    type: LOGOUT
		  }
		};
		
		○ Note: LOGIN and LOGOUT are created as immutable variables, then referenced as needed. This is common practice with Redux to avoid misspellings that could happen if you wrote out a string everytime instead of referencing a variable

Adding Data to an Action
	• When an action happens, it's generally cause by user input, which means that data will go along with the action.
		○ This is done by allowing arguments to pass through the action, to the reducer, then to the store
		
		const ADD_NOTE = 'ADD_NOTE';
		
		const notesReducer = (state = 'Initial State', action) => {
		  switch(action.type) {
		    // The reducer updates state with user input when the ADD_NOTE action happens
		    case ADD_NOTE:
		      return state = action.text;
		    default:
		      return state;
		  }
		};
		
		// The action creator takes 'note' as an argument and pairs it with key 'text'
		const addNoteText = (note) => {
		  return {
		    type: 'ADD_NOTE',
		    text: note
		  }
		};
		
		const store = Redux.createStore(notesReducer);
		
		console.log(store.getState());
		// logs: 'Initial State'
		store.dispatch(addNoteText('Hello!'));
		console.log(store.getState());
		// logs: 'Hello!'
		
Store Listeners
	• The store.subscribe() method allows us to subscribe listener functions to the store
		○ The listener functions are called whenever an action is dispatched against the store
		○ A simple use for this is to subscribe a function that simply logs a message every time an action is received and the store is updated
	
		const ADD = 'ADD';
		
		const reducer = (state = 0, action) => {
		  switch(action.type) {
		    case ADD:
		      return state + 1;
		    default:
		      return state;
		  }
		};
		
		const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);
		
		let count = 0;
		
		// callback function
		const addOne = () => {
		  count += 1;
		  console.log(count);
		};
		
		// assign callback as action listener
		store.subscribe(addOne);
		
		store.dispatch({type: ADD});
		store.dispatch({type: ADD});
		store.dispatch({type: ADD});
		/* would print to the log:
			1
			2
			3 */

Combining Reducers
	• When the state of an app becomes complex, it may be tempting to split state into multiple pieces
		○ Remember the frist priciple of Redux: all app state is held in a single state object in the store
		○ Redux provides reducer composition as a solution for a complex state model
			§ You define multiple reducers to handle different pieces of the application's state, then compose those reducers into one root reducer
			§ The root reducer is passed into the Redux createStore() method
	• In order to combine multiple reducers together, Redux provides the combineReducers() method
		○ This method accepts an object as an argument where you define properties which associate keys to specific reducer funcitons
		○ The name you give to the keys will be used by Redux as the name for the associated piece of state
	• Typically, it's good practice to create a reducer for each piece of applications state when they are distinct or unique in some way
		○ e.g. in a not-taking app that has user authentication, we would have one reducer of the authentication and another to handle the text and notes that the use submits.
		○ For this, we might write a combineReducers() method like this:
		
		const rootReducer = Redux.combineReducers({
		  auth: authenticationReducer,
		  notes: notesReducer
		});
		
		○ An extended example:
		
		const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';
		const DECREMENT = 'DECREMENT';
		
		// A reducer for an action that increases and decreases state
		const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
		  switch(action.type) {
		    case INCREMENT:
		      return state + 1;
		    case DECREMENT:
		      return state - 1;
		    default:
		      return state;
		  }
		};
		
		const LOGIN = 'LOGIN';
		const LOGOUT = 'LOGOUT';
		
		// A reducer that handles user authentication
		const authReducer = (state = {authenticated: false}, action) => {
		  switch(action.type) {
		    case LOGIN:
		      return {
		        authenticated: true
		      }
		    case LOGOUT:
		      return {
		        authenticated: false
		      }
		    default:
		      return state;
		  }
		};
		
		// Combining the two reducers into one root reducer
		const rootReducer = Redux.combineReducers({
		  auth: authReducer,
		  count: counterReducer
		});
		
		// Passing the root reducer to the Redux store
		const store = Redux.createStore(rootReducer);
		
Handling Asynchronous Actions
	• So far, there have been no asynchronous actions (actions that take time to complete such as a server request) in the examples.
		○ Redux provides middleware designed specifically for asynchronous requests called Redux Thunk middleware
	• Brief rundown of how to use this with Redux:
		○ To include Redux Thunk middleware, pass it as an argument to Redux.applyMiddleware()
			§ This statement is provided as a second optional parameter to the createStore() function
		○ To create an asynchronous action, you return a funciton in the action creator that takes dispatch as an argument
			§ Within this function, you can dispatch actions and perform asynchronous requests
	• In the following example, an asynchronous request is simulated with a setTimeout() call
		○ It's common to dispatch an action before initiating any asynchronous behavior so that your app state knows that data is being requested
			§ This state could diplay a loading icon
		○ Once data is received, another action is dispatched that carries the data as a payload along with information that the action is completed
	
	const REQUESTING_DATA = 'REQUESTING_DATA'
	const RECEIVED_DATA = 'RECEIVED_DATA'
	
	// Action creators for requesting and received data
	const requestingData = () => { return {type: REQUESTING_DATA} }
	const receivedData = (data) => { return {type: RECEIVED_DATA, users: data.users} }
	
	// Middleware to handle both states - requesting and received
	// It returns a function that passes dispatch as an argument
	const handleAsync = () => {
	  return function(dispatch) {
	    // Dispatch of action on request
	    dispatch(requestingData());
	    setTimeout(function() {
	      let data = {
	        users: ['Jeff', 'William', 'Alice']
	      }
	      // Dispatch of action on delivery
	    dispatch(receivedData(data));
	    }, 2500);
	  }
	};
	
	const defaultState = {
	  fetching: false,
	  users: []
	};
	
	// Reducer function
	const asyncDataReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
	  switch(action.type) {
	    // When requesting data, set fetching to true
	    case REQUESTING_DATA:
	      return {
	        fetching: true,
	        users: []
	      }
	    // Once data is received, fetching is false and received data is asigned to users
	    case RECEIVED_DATA:
	      return {
	        fetching: false,
	        users: action.users
	      }
	    default:
	      return state;
	  }
	};
	
	// Note the second argument here that allows us to use Redux Thunk
	const store = Redux.createStore(
	  asyncDataReducer,
	  Redux.applyMiddleware(ReduxThunk.default)
	);
	
	
Never Mutate State!
	• When updating state, always return a new state instead of mutating the current state
		○ When manipulating arrays, use the spread operator, .concat, and .splice
		○ When manipulating objects, use Object.assign()
			§ Object.assign() takes a target object and source object and maps properties from the source objects to the target object
			§ Matching properties are overwritten by properties in the source objects
			§ This is commonly used to make shallow copues by passing an empty object as the first argument, followed by the object(s) you want to copy
		
const newObject = Object.assign({}, obj1, obj2);
