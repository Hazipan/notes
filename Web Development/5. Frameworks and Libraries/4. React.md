	React is an open source library made and maintained by Facebook. It's a tool for rendering the UI (User Interface) of modern web applications. React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows us to write HTML directly within JavaScript. This lets us use the full power of JavaScript within HTML.

JSX is similar to HTML with some key differences. For example, since JSX is an extension of JavaScript we can use JavaScript code inside the document. Anything encompassed with curly braces is treated as JavaScript. However! Since JSX isn't valid JavaScript, it must be compiled ino JavaScript.

Babel is a popular tool for this process and must be added in on its own

# Putting React and JSX in a Project

Use [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev)

# JSX Elements

Declaring elements in JSX is a syntatical mix of JS and HTML. JSX are stored as objects and can be assigned to variables in JS. To create an `<h1>` element in JSX, we can do this:
		
```JSX
const header = <h1>Hello JSX!</h1>;
// Creates a variable called header that stores an h1 HTML element
```

It's important to know that JSX can only return one element. So if you wanted to display 3 `<p>` elements with one JSX element, you'd need to wrap them in `<div>` tags. Think of it as a kind of array:
		
```JSX
const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h1>This is a block of JSX</h1>
    <p>Here's a subtitle</p>
  </div>
);
```
		
Comments are created the same as JS but with curly braces when done inside HTML variables, otherwise it is the same as JS.
		
```JSX
{/* I am a comment :)*/}
```
		
# Rendering to the DOM

To render to the DOM we use the `ReactDOM.render()` method. It takes 2 arugments:

1. The component to render
2. The target node

You can pass defined JSX elements directly as the first argument. And ycan use `document.getElementById([element id])` to select the DOM node to render them to.
			
```JSX
ReactDOM.render(header, document.getElementById('root');
```
		
# Defining HTML Classes in JSX

One key difference between JSX and HTML is that we can nolonger use `class` to define classes because `class` is an important keyword in JS. Instead, JSX uses `className`. All HTML attributes need to be put in camelCase in JSX.
		
```JSX
const JSX = (
  <div className='myDiv'>
    <h1>Add a class to this div</h1>
  </div>
);
```
		
Another key difference is self closing tags. In JSX, all elements must be closed. That means an opening and closing tag. If the tag normally self closes in HTML, then you must add a slash to the end of the tag. So the line break tag (`<br>`) would be written as `<br />`.

You can do this with any element in JSX, but if you do this in, for example, a `<div>` (`<div />`) tag, you wouldn't be able to put anything inside the `<div>` tag. This will be useful for rendering React components.

# Components

Everything in React is a component and we are going to learn how to build our own component in two ways

1. The first way to is to use a JS funciton:
			
```JSX
const DemoComponent = function(props) {
  return (
    <div className='customClass' />
  );
};
```

Defining a component this way creats a *stateless functional* component. The concept of state in an application will be covered later. For now, think of it as a component that can receive and render data, but does not manage it or track changes to it. To do this, simply write a JavaScript function that either returns a JSX object or `null`. One important stipulation is that React requires your function name to begin with a capital letter.

Because JSX components represent HTML, you could put several components together to create a complex HTML page. This allows us to compose our UI form many separate, isolated components. This makes it easier to build and maintain complex user interfaces

The second way to define a React component is with the ES6 class syntax
		
```JSX
class Kitten extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hi</h1>
    );
  }
}
```
		
		○ This creates a class (Kitten) that extends React.Component
			§ This gives it many useful React features like local state and lifecycle hooks
		○ Notice the constructor that calls super()
			§ It uses super() to call the constructor of the parent class
				□ Here, it's the constructor for React.Componenet
			§ The constructor is a special method used during initialization of objects that are created with the class keyword
			§ It's best practice to call a component's constructor with super, and pass props to both
				□ This makes sure that the component is initialized properly
				□ For now, know that it is standard for this code to be included

Composing Multiple Components Together
	• Say we were building an app with three separate components: Navbar, Dashboard, and Footer
		○ We can render all three components at once by creating an App parent component that renders the other three as children
		○ To render a component as a child, include the component name written as a custom HTML tag
		○ So, in the render method of our App component, we could do this:
		
		return (
		  <App>
		    <Navbar />
		    <Dashboard />
		    <Footer />
		  </App>
		);
		
	• Components are a powerful feature in React
		○ Start thinking of the UI in terms of components
		○ Break down the UI into basic building blocks and let those blocks become components
		○ This helps separate code responsible for the UI from the code responsible for handling logic
		○ This greatly simplifies development and maintenance of complex projects
	• Note: You can render JSX elements, stateless functional components, and ES6 components within other components
	• Previously, we've seen how to render JSX to the DOM. Rendering React components looks very similar.
		○ To render to the DOM, se use the ReactDOM.render() funciton
		○ It takes 2 arguments
			1. The React component you want to render
				□ The syntax for this is <ComponentToRender />
			2. The DOM node that you want to rener that component within
		
		ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, document.getElementById('my-node'));
		
Properties (Props)
	• We can pass properties to child components by creating cusom properties.
	• We assign properties in the parent component. 
		○ For example:
		
		<App>
		  <Welcome user='Mark' />
		</App>

		○ This creates a custom property called user and assigns it to the Welcome component (which in this example is stateless)
		○ Since the Welcome component is stateless, it has access to the property
		
		const Welcome = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.user}!</h1>
		
		○ When dealing with stateless funcitonal components, we consider props as an argument to a function wich returns JSX
		○ We can access the value of the argument in the function body
		
		const CurrentDate = (props) => {
		  return (
		    <div>
		      <p>The current date is: {props.date}</p>
		    </div>
		  );
		};
		// This is a stateless functional component
		
		class Calendar extends React.Component {
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		  }
		  render() {
		    return (
		      <div>
		        <h3>What date is it?</h3>
		        <CurrentDate date={Date()}/>
		      </div>
		    );
		  }
		};
		// This is an ES6 style component
		
		ReactDOM.render(<Calendar />, document.getElementById('root');
		// Displays the current date
		
		○ Note that the value for the date property comes from a JS funciton and is therefore encompassed by curly braces
	• We can pass an entire array as a propety
		○ Since arrays are JS syntax, they must be encompassed by curly brackets
		
		<ParentComponent>
		  <ChildComponent color={[green, blue, red]} />
		</PartenComponent>
		
		○ Array methods such as join() can be used when accessing the property

Default Props
	• You can assign default props to a component as a property on the component itself and React assigns the default prop if necessary
		○ This allows you to specify what a prop value should be if no value is explicitly provided
		○ Example:
		
		MyComponent.defaultProps = { location: 'San Francisco' }
		
	• You can override default props by explicitly setting the prop values for a component
	• Note: when a value needs to be set as an interger, it won't go in quotes and needs to be wrapped in curly braces

PropTypes
	• React provides type-checking features to verify that components receive props of the correct type
		○ Example: your application makes an API call to retrieve data that you expect to be in an array, which is them passed to a component as a prop
		○ You can set propTypes on your component to require the data to be of type array
		○ This will throw a useful warning when the data is of any other type
	• It's considered best practice to set propTypes when you know the type of a prop ahead of time
		○ Example: require the type function for a prop called handleClick
		
		MyComponent.propTypes = { handleClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired }
		
		○ This tells react that handleClick should be a function and that it's required to be there
		○ It throws in error if its not there or if it's not a funciton
	• Only function an boolean use unusual spelling (func and bool)
	• See the documentation for all options to use with propTypes
	• Also, proptypes is important independantly from React
	
		PropTypes from 'prop-types';
	
this.props
	• The previous ways we've used to access props has been for stateless functional components
	• If you have an ES6 class component, it's slightly different
		○ Anytime you refer to a class component within itself, you use the this keyword
		○ To access props within a class component, you preface the code that you use to access it with this
		
		{this.props.propName}
		

Conclusion for stateless components and stateless functional components
	• Stateless fuctional components act like pure function. They accept props as input and return the same view every time they are passed the same props
	• They are any funciton you write which accepts props and returns JSX
	• A stateless component is a class that extends React.Component, but doesn't use internal state
	• A stateful component is a class component that does maintain its own internal state
		○ These are refered to as React Components
	• Good practice is to minimize statefulness and create stateless functional components wherever possible.
		○ This helps contain our state management to a specific area for you
		○ This improves development and maintenanc of your app by making it easier to follow how changes to state affect its behavior

Stateful Components
	• State is the most important topic in React
	• State consists of any data your application needs to know about, that can change over time
		○ We want our apps to respond to state changes and present an updated UI when necessary
	• We create state in a component by declaring a state property on the component in its constructor
		○ This initializes the component with state when it is created
		○ The state property must be set to a JS object
		
		this.state = {}
		
	• We have access to the state object throughout the life of the component
		○ We can update it, render it in our UI, and pass it as props to child components
		○ The state object can be as complex or simple as needed
		○ Note: you must create a class component that extends React.Component in order to create state like this

Render State in the UI
	• Once a components intitial state is defined, we can display any part of it in the UI that is rendered
		○ If a component is stateful, it will always have access to the data in state in its render() mehtod
		○ You can access state data with this.state
	• When accessing state within the return value of the render method, be sure to enclose the value in curly braces
	• State allows us to track important data in our app and render a UI in response to those changes
		○ If our data chages, the UI cahnges
		○ React uses what is called a virtual DOM to keep track of changes behind the scenes
		○ When state data updates, it triggers a re-render of the components using that data - including child components that receibved the datat as a prop
			§ React updates the DOM, but only where necessary
	• Note: if a component is stateful, no other component is aware of its state. Its state is completely encapsulated, or local to that component, unless you pass state data to a child component as props. This is very important because it allows us to write certain logic, then have that logic contained and isolated in one place of our code
	• Another way to render state to the UI is to use the space at the top of the return function, but before the return statement
		○ This space can have JS written in it directly. We can declare functions, access data, state, or props, etc.
		○ This JS can the be access from the retrun statement
		
		render() {
		  const name = this.state.name;
		  return (
		    <div>
		      <h1>{name}</h1>
		    </div>
		  );
		}
		
		
Set State
	• There is a method provided for updating sate called setState
		○ You call it within our component class
			§ this.setState()
		○ Passing an object with key-value pairs to it updates the state of the component
		
		this.setState({
		  username: "Hazipan"
		});
		
	• React expect you to never modify state directly
		○ Always use this.setState() when state changes occur

Bind 'this' to a Class Method
	• In addition to setting and updating state, you can also define methods for your component class
		○ A class method typically needs to use the this keyword so it can access properties (like state and props) inside the scope of the method.
	• A common way is to explicitly bind this in the constructor so this becomes bound to the class methods when the component is initialized
	• Binding 'this' allows us to use the this keyword and have it refer to the class and not be undefined
		
		class MyComponent extends React.Component {
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		    this.state = {
		      text: "Hello"
		    };
		    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
		  }
		  handleClick() {
		    this.setState({
		      text: "You clicked!"
		    });
		  }
		  render() {
		    return (
		      <div>
		        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>
		        <h1>{this.state.text}</h1>
		      </div>
		    );
		  }
		};
		
		
	• Note: The this keyword is the most confusing aspect of JS but plays an important role in React.

Use State to Toggle an Element
	• Someties, yo may need to know the previous state when updating state, but state updates can be asynchronous, meaning multiple setState() calls can get budled into one update
		○ That means you cannot rely on the previoius value of this.sate or this.props
		○ So, we never use code like this:
		
		this.setState({
		  counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment
		});
		
	• Instead, we need to pass setState a function that allows us to acces state and props
		○ Using afunction with setState guarantees that we are working with the most current values of state and props
		○ So, we would rewrite the above like this:
		
		this.setState((state, props) => ({
		  counter: state.counter + props.increment
		}));
		
		○ You cold also use a form without props if you only need state

		this.setState(state => ({
		  counter: state.counter + 1
		}));
		
		○ Note: you'll need to wrap the object literal in parentheses, otherwise JS thinks it's a block of code

	• Using these concept to create a toggleable element:
		
		class MyComponent extends React.Component {
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		    this.state = {
		      visibility: false
		    };
		    this.toggleVisibility = this.toggleVisibility.bind(this);
		  }
		  toggleVisibility() {
		    if(this.state.visibility == true) {
		      this.setState(state => ({
		        visibility: false
		      }));
		    } else{
		      this.setState(state => ({
		        visibility: true
		      }));
		    }
		  }
		  render() {
		    if (this.state.visibility) {
		      return (
		        <div>
		          <button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}>Click Me</button>
		          <h1>Now you see me!</h1>
		        </div>
		      );
		    } else {
		      return (
		        <div>
		          <button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}>Click Me</button>
		        </div>
		      );
		    }
		  }
		};
		
	• A simple counter app using everything so far
		
		class Counter extends React.Component {
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		    this.state = {
		      count: 0
		    };
		
		    this.increment = this.increment.bind(this);
		    this.decrement = this.decrement.bind(this);
		    this.reset = this.reset.bind(this);
		  }
		
		  increment() {
		    this.setState(state => ({
		      count: state.count + 1
		    }));
		  }
		
		  decrement() {
		    this.setState(state => ({
		      count: state.count - 1
		    }));
		  }
		
		  reset() {
		    this.setState(state => ({
		      count: 0
		    }));
		  }
		
		  render() {
		    return (
		      <div>
		        <button className='inc' onClick={this.increment}>Increment!</button>
		        <button className='dec' onClick={this.decrement}>Decrement!</button>
		        <button className='reset' onClick={this.reset}>Reset</button>
		        <h1>Current Count: {this.state.count}</h1>
		      </div>
		    );
		  }
		};

Controlled Input
	• Interactions between state and UI get more complex when working with control elements
		○ Elements that take in user input such as form elements like input and textarea
		○ These elements maintain their own state in the DOM as the user types
		○ With React, we can move the mutable state of these elements into a React component's state
			§ Then the user input becomes part of the applications state, so React can control the value of that input field
		
		class ControlledInput extends React.Component {
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		    this.state = {
		      input: ''
		    };
		    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this)
		  }
			
		  handleChange(event) {
		    this.setState({
		      input: event.target.value
		    });
		  }
			
		  render() {
		    return (
		      <div>
		        <input value = {this.state.input} onChange = {this.handleChange}/>
		        <h4>Controlled Input:</h4>
		        <p>{this.state.input}</p>
		      </div>
		    );
		  }
		};
		

Unidirectional Data Flow & Seperating State and UI
	• Unidirectional data flow and seperating state and UI are two key concepts that are use in React
	• Unidirectional data flow is were we ensure that user data (state) flows in one direction down the tree of our application's components
		○ We have a stateful parent component that passes information to child components
		○ Child components only receive the data that they need
	• Seperating state and UI is the concept of breaking stateful apps into only a few (possibly even just one) stateful components
		○ The rest of our components simpy render a UI from that state
		○ This creates a seperation where state management is handle in one place and UI rendering in another
			§ This makes managing complex applications much easier
		
		class MyApp extends React.Component {
		// This component holds the state so we manage it in one place
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		    this.state = {
		        name: 'CamperBot'
		    }
		  }
		  render() {
		    return (
		      <div>
		        <Navbar user={this.state.name}/>
		        {/* The stateful component passes a piece of state to another compnent as props
		        It only passes what the other component needs, not everything. */}
		      </div>
		    );
		  }
		};
		
		class Navbar extends React.Component {
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		  }
		  render() {
		    return (
		      <div>
		        <h1>Hello, my name is: {this.props.user}</h1>
		        {/* The non-stateful component utilize the piece of state that was passed to it from its props */}
		      </div>
		    );
		  }
		};
		
	• Passing things through as props (like in the example above) is not limited to data
		○ We can also pass handler function or any mehtod that's defined on a React component to a child component
		○ That's how child components interact with parent components
		○ We pass it just like a regular prop
			§ It's assigned a name and accessed under this.props in the child
		○ Example to see how data flows:
		
		class MyApp extends React.Component {
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		    this.state = {
		      inputValue: ''
		    }
		    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
		  }
		  handleChange(event) {
		    this.setState({
		      inputValue: event.target.value
		    });
		  }
		  render() {
		    return (
		       <div>
		          <GetInput 
		            input={this.state.inputValue}
		            handleChange={this.handleChange}
		          />
		          <RenderInput input={this.state.inputValue}/>
		       </div>
		    );
		  }
		};
		
		class GetInput extends React.Component {
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		  }
		  render() {
		    return (
		      <div>
		        <h3>Get Input:</h3>
		        <input
		          value={this.props.input}
		          onChange={this.props.handleChange}/>
		      </div>
		    );
		  }
		};
		
		class RenderInput extends React.Component {
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		  }
		  render() {
		    return (
		      <div>
		        <h3>Input Render:</h3>
		        <p>{this.props.input}</p>
		      </div>
		    );
		  }
		};
		
		○ This is a contrived example to see how data can flow between three compenents and still be unidirectional
		
Lifecycle Methods
	• React components have several special methods that provide opportunities to perform actions at specific points in the lifecycle of the component
		○ These are called lifecycle methods or lifecycle hooks
		○ These allow us to catch the components at certain times such as before it is rendered, before it updates, before props are received, before they unmount, etc.
	• Some main lifecycle methods:
		○ componentWillMount()
		○ componentDidMount()
		○ shouldComponentUpdate()
		○ componentDidUpdate()
		○ componentWillUnmount()

componentWillMount()
	• Note: the componentWillMount method will be removed in version 17
	• The componentWillMount() method is called before the render() method when a component is being mounted to the DOM
	
		class MyComponent extends React.Component {
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		  }
		  componentWillMount() {
		    {console.log("Hello world!")}
		  }
		  render() {
		    return <div />
		  }
		};
		
componentDidMount() & componentWillUnmount()
	• At some point, you will need to call an API endpoint to retrieve data and it's imortant to know where to perform this action
		○ Best practice in React is to place API calls or any calls to your server in the lifecycle method componentDidMount()
		○ This method is called after the component is mounted to the DOM
			§ Any calls to setState() here will trigger a re-render of your component.
		○ When you call an API in this mehtod, and set your state with the data returned by the API, it will automatically trigger an update once you receive the data.
		
		class MyComponent extends React.Component {
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		    this.state = {
		      activeUsers: null
		    };
		  }
		  componentDidMount() {
		    // Mock method to simulate a call to a server that takes 2.5 seconds
		    setTimeout(() => {
		      this.setState({
		        activeUsers: 1273
		      });
		    }, 2500);
		  }
		  render() {
		    return (
		      <div>
		        <h1>Active Users: {this.state.activeUsers}</h1>
		      </div>
		    );
		  }
		}
		
	• This method is also the best place to add event listeners you need to add for specific functionality
		○ React provides a synthetic event system which wraps the native event system present in browsers
			§ It behaves exactly the same regardless of the user's browser, even if the native events may behave differently between different browsers
			§ One we've used previously is onClick()
		○ React's synthetic event handlers is greate for most interactions you'll manage on DOM elements, but if you want to attach a handler to the document or window objects, you'll have to do it directly
		
		class MyComponent extends React.Component {
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		    this.state = {
		      message: ''
		    };
		    this.handleEnter = this.handleEnter.bind(this);
		    this.handleKeyPress = this.handleKeyPress.bind(this);
		  }
		  componentDidMount() {
		    // Add an event listener when the component is mounted
		    document.addEventListener("keydown", this.handleKeyPress);
		  }
		  componentWillUnmount() {
		    // Remove the event listener when the component is about to unmount
		    document.removeEventListener("keydown", this.handleKeyPress)
		  }
		  handleEnter() {
		    this.setState((state) => ({
		      message: state.message + 'You pressed the enter key! '
		    }));
		  }
		  handleKeyPress(event) {
		    if (event.keyCode === 13) {
		      this.handleEnter();
		    }
		  }
		  render() {
		    return (
		      <div>
		        <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
		      </div>
		    );
		  }
		};
		
		○ It's good practice to use the componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method to do any clean up on React components before they are unmounted and destroyed.
			§ Removing event listeners is an example of one such clean up aciton.

shouldComponentUpdate()
	• This method is used to optimize re-renders
	• Normally, a component re-renders itself and all its children if it receives new state or new props
		○ The souldComponentUpdate() method compares the the state and props of the current component to what it wants to update to
		○ If there is no change in the state or props, it prevents the re-render
	• It takes two parameters: nextProps and nextState
		○ It returns true or false after comparing to this.props or this.state to determine if a re-render is needed
		
		class OnlyEvens extends React.Component {
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		  }
		  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
		    console.log('Should I update?');
		    if(nextProps.value % 2 == 0){
		      return true
		    }
		    return false;
		  }
		  componentDidUpdate() {
		    console.log('Component re-rendered.');
		  }
		  render() {
		    return <h1>{this.props.value}</h1>;
		  }
		}
		
		class Controller extends React.Component {
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		    this.state = {
		      value: 0
		    };
		    this.addValue = this.addValue.bind(this);
		  }
		  addValue() {
		    this.setState(state => ({
		      value: state.value + 1
		    }));
		  }
		  render() {
		    return (
		      <div>
		        <button onClick={this.addValue}>Add</button>
		        <OnlyEvens value={this.state.value} />
		      </div>
		    );
		  }
		}

Inline Styles
	• With JSX elements, we can still import style sheets by giving elemnts the className attribuate
	• We can also do inline styles, which is very common in ReactJS
	
		<div style={{color: "yellow", fontSize: 16}}>Mellow Yello</div>
	
		○ Note that fontSize is camelCase not kebab-case
		○ Also note that the size is just a number, rather than "16px"
			§ You could do either
		○ All property value length units are assumed to be in px unless otherwise specified
			§ Otherwise it looks like this
	
		{fontSize: "4em"}
		
	• We could also create an style object to keep our code more organized
		
		const styles = {
		  color: "purple",
		  fontSize: 40,
		  border: "2px solid purple"
		}
		
		class Colorful extends React.Component {
		  render() {
		    return (
		      <div style={styles}>Style Me!</div>
		    );
		    // Change code above this line
		  }
		};
		
Render with an If-Else Condition
	• You can use JavaScript to control which elements are rendered using conditionals
	• You can do this with a statndard if-else statement in the render() method
		
		class MyComponent extends React.Component {
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		    this.state = {
		      display: true
		    }
		    this.toggleDisplay = this.toggleDisplay.bind(this);
		  }
		  toggleDisplay() {
		    this.setState((state) => ({
		      display: !state.display
		    }));
		  }
		  render() {
		    if(this.state.display) {
		      return (
		        <div>
		          <button onClick={this.toggleDisplay}>Toggle Display</button>
		          <h1>Displayed!</h1>
		        </div>
		      );
		    } else {
		      return (
		        <div>
		          <button onClick={this.toggleDisplay}>Toggle Display</button>
		        </div>
		      );
		    }
		  }
		};
		
	• We can achieve the same result by using the && operator to perform the logic in a more concise way
		○ We can do this because we want to check a condition, and if it is, return some markup
		
		{condition && <p>markup</p>}
		
		○ If the condition is true, the markup is returned
		○ If the condition is false, the operation will return false immediately after evaluating the condition and return nothing
		○ We can use this directly in out JSX and string multiple condition together by writing && after each one
			§ Allows us to handle more complex conditional logic in our render() method, without repeating lots of code
		
		class MyComponent extends React.Component {
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		    this.state = {
		      display: true
		    }
		    this.toggleDisplay = this.toggleDisplay.bind(this);
		  }
		  toggleDisplay() {
		    this.setState(state => ({
		      display: !state.display
		    }));
		  }
		  render() {
		    return (
		       <div>
		         <button onClick={this.toggleDisplay}>Toggle Display</button>
		         {this.state.display && <h1>Displayed!</h1>}
		       </div>
		    );
		  }
		};
		
	• Another way to use JS ocnditionals to render what we want is to use ternary operators
		○ They are often used as shortcut for if-else statements in JS
		○ Regular if-else statements can't be insterted directly into JSX, so ternary operators are an excellent alternative for impementing conditionals within the JSX
		○ Basic syntax:
		
		condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
		
		○ Example with chained ternary conditional:
		
		const inputStyle = {
		  width: 235,
		  margin: 5
		};
		
		class CheckUserAge extends React.Component {
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		    // Change code below this line
		    this.state = {
		      input: "",
		      userAge: ""
		    }
		    // Change code above this line
		    this.submit = this.submit.bind(this);
		    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
		  }
		  handleChange(e) {
		    this.setState({
		      input: e.target.value,
		      userAge: ''
		    });
		  }
		  submit() {
		    this.setState(state => ({
		      userAge: state.input
		    }));
		  }
		  render() {
		    const buttonOne = <button onClick={this.submit}>Submit</button>;
		    const buttonTwo = <button>You May Enter</button>;
		    const buttonThree = <button>You Shall Not Pass</button>;
		    return (
		      <div>
		        <h3>Enter Your Age to Continue</h3>
		        <input
		          style={inputStyle}
		          type='number'
		          value={this.state.input}
		          onChange={this.handleChange}
		        />
		        <br />
		        {/* conditional to set what button displays depending on user input */}
		        {this.state.userAge === ""
		          ? buttonOne
		          : this.state.userAge >= 18
		            ? buttonTwo
		            : buttonThree
		        }
		      </div>
		    );
		  }
		}
	 
	• We can combine conditional logic with props to create specific visuals depending on the properties of an element
		○ A simpnle game where you click a button and have a 50/50 chance of winning:
	
		class Results extends React.Component {
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		  }
		  render() {
		    return (
		      <h1>{this.props.fiftyFifty ? 'You Win!' : 'You Lose!'}</h1>
		    )
		  }
		}
		
		class GameOfChance extends React.Component {
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		    this.state = {
		      counter: 1
		    };
		    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
		  }
		  handleClick() {
		    this.setState(prevState => {
		      return {
		        counter: prevState.counter + 1
		      }
		    });
		  }
		  render() {
		    const expression = Math.random() >= .5;
		    return (
		      <div>
		        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Play Again</button>
		        <Results fiftyFifty = {expression}/>
		        <p>{'Turn: ' + this.state.counter}</p>
		      </div>
		    );
		  }
		}
		
	• We can use all the previous concepts to change in-line styling depending on a condition:
		
		class GateKeeper extends React.Component {
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		    this.state = {
		      input: ''
		    };
		    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
		  }
		  handleChange(event) {
		    this.setState({ input: event.target.value })
		  }
		  render() {
		    let inputStyle = {
		      border: '1px solid black'
		    };
		    if(this.state.input.length > 15){
		      inputStyle.border = '3px solid red'
		    }
		    return (
		      <div>
		        <h3>Don't Type Too Much:</h3>
		        <input
		          type="text"
		          style={inputStyle}
		          value={this.state.input}
		          onChange={this.handleChange} />
		      </div>
		    );
		  }
		};
		
Array.map() & Array.filter() to Render Elements
	• Sometimes we might need our components to render an unknown number of times and we have no way of knowing how many times until runtime because so much depends on a user's interaction
		○ We can use Array.map() to illustrate this concept
		○ A component that creates a number of <li> elements, depending on user input
	
		const textAreaStyles = {
		  width: 235,
		  margin: 5
		};
		
		class MyToDoList extends React.Component {
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		    this.state = {
		      userInput: '',
		      toDoList: []
		    }
		    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
		    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
		  }
		  handleSubmit() {
		    const itemsArray = this.state.userInput.split(',');
		    this.setState({
		      toDoList: itemsArray
		    });
		  }
		  handleChange(e) {
		    this.setState({
		      userInput: e.target.value
		    });
		  }
		  render() {
		    const items = this.state.toDoList.map((elem, index) => {
		      return(
		        <li key={index}>{elem}</li>
		      )
		    });
		    return (
		      <div>
		        <textarea
		          onChange={this.handleChange}
		          value={this.state.userInput}
		          style={textAreaStyles}
		          placeholder='Separate Items With Commas'
		        />
		        <br />
		        <button onClick={this.handleSubmit}>Create List</button>
		        <h1>My "To Do" List:</h1>
		        <ul>{items}</ul>
		      </div>
		    );
		  }
		}
		
		○ Notice the key attibute for each list item. 
			§ When mapping over data like this, each element needs its own unique key attribute
			§ The key attribute only needs to be unique among sibling elements, not globally. 
			§ This helps make the re-rendering process more efficient when the list is modified in any way.
		○ The map array method is used very often in React
	• Another method used often is Array.filter()
		○ This mehtod filters the contents of an array based on a condition, then returns a new array
		○ i.e. an array of users that all have an online status that can be true or false. You can filter only those users that are online
		
		let onlineUsers = users.filter(user => user.online);
		
		○ Filtering online users full example:
		
		class MyComponent extends React.Component {
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		    this.state = {
		      users: [
		        {
		          username: 'Jeff',
		          online: true
		        },
		        {
		          username: 'Alan',
		          online: false
		        },
		        {
		          username: 'Mary',
		          online: true
		        },
		        {
		          username: 'Jim',
		          online: false
		        },
		        {
		          username: 'Sara',
		          online: true
		        },
		        {
		          username: 'Laura',
		          online: true
		        }
		      ]
		    };
		  }
		  render() {
		    const usersOnline = this.state.users.filter(user => user.online);
		    const renderOnline = usersOnline.map((element, index) => {
		      return(
		        <li key={index}>{element.username}</li>
		      )
		    });
		    return (
		      <div>
		        <h1>Current Online Users:</h1>
		        <ul>{renderOnline}</ul>
		      </div>
		    );
		  }
		}
		
Render React on the Server with renderToString()
	• So far, we've been rendering components on the client and normally this is what we will always do
		○ However, there are cases where it's better to render components on the server
		○ Since React is a JS library and we can run JS with Node, we can render on the server
		○ React provides renderToString() for this purpose
	• Two reasons why you might render on the server:
		1. Without doing this, our React apps would consist of a relatively empty HTML file and a large bundle of JS when it's initially loaded to the browser
			§ This isn't ideal for search engines that are trying to index the content of your page so people can find you
			§ If you render the initial HTML markup on the server and send it to the client, the initial page load contains all of the page's markup which can be crawled by search engines
		2. This creates a faster initial page load experience because the rendered HTML is smaller than the JS code of the entire app
			§ React will still be able to recognize your app and manage it after the initial load
		
		class App extends React.Component {
		  constructor(props) {
		    super(props);
		  }
		  render() {
		    return <div/>
		  }
		};
		
ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<App />);
