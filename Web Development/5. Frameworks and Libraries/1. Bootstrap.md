Applying Bootstrap
	• Bootstrap resizes elements based on screen width, making our web pages responsive
		○ This way there is no need to design a mobile version of our website, it will look good at any width.
		○ We add Bootstrap to a webpage by linking it in at the top of the HTML
		
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous"/>
		
	• To get started, wrap all of your HTML (except the link tag and style element) in a div and set its class to container-fluid

Responsive Images
	• To make images responsive to the width of our screen, we give our image the class img-responsive
		○ This makes it fill up the width of the screen up to the images original width
	
	Remember: You can add several classes to one object by seperating class names with a space

Responsive Text
	• We can center text by adding the class text-center to an element
	
Bootstrap Buttons
	• Bootstrap has their own styles for button elements that look far better than HMTL ones
	• To create a bootstrap button, create a button element give the classes btn and btn-default
		
		<button class="btn btn-default">Button</button>
		
	• Creating a button like the one above will create a button that is only as wide as the text it contains
		○ By making it a block element, the button will stretch to fill the page's entire horizontal space and any elements following it will flow onto a new line below the block.
		○ To do this we add an additional class: btn-block
		
		<button class="btn btn-default btn-block">Block Button</button>
		
	• We can replace the btn-default class with the btn-primary class
		○ This makes the button the main color we are using
		○ It's useful for highlighting actions we want our users to take
		
		<button class="btn btn-primary btn-block">Primary Button</button>
		
	• Bootstrap has several pre-defined colors beyond btn-primary
		○ The btn-info class is the button color used to call attention to optional actions that the user can take
		○ The btn-danger class is the button color to notify users that the button performs a destructive action
		○ If you replace btn with text, these color classes can be applied to text elements

Bootstrap Grid
	• Bootstrap uses a responsive, 12-column grid system that makes it easy to put elements into rows and specify each element's relative width.
		○ Most of bootstrap's classes can be applied to a div element
	• The Bootstrap grid has differend column width attributes that it uses depending on how wide the user's screen is
		○ We can specify how objects fit in the grid by using one of the various col classes
		○ The syntax is col-[size]-[num]
			§ size is the size of screen the page will be used on. This provides the base width of the grid. If the screen size gets smaller than the total grid width, then the elements will come out of the grid. 
				□ Phone screens are xs and it's best to use this, as it creates a mobile-first design
				□ When the screen gets bigger than the grids total width, than the grid sizes up responsively
			§ num is how many columns the element would span. Remember that the bootstrap grid is 12 columns in total

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-xs-4">
				<button class="btn btn-block btn-primary">Like</button>
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-4">
				<button class="btn btn-block btn-info">Info</button>
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-4">
				<button class="btn btn-block btn-danger">Delete</button>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		○ This creates a row in a bootstrap grid where each button takes up 4 columns on an xs size grid, which means we have 3, responsive buttons that are lined up nicely.
	• This can be used to create a nice, custom header. We can put an img element and a header element into a row and assign the column widths to create custom, responsive headers.
	• Setting another div element inside the column class div element and assigning it the class well can create a sense of visual depth for your columns
		
Span Elements
	• We can use spans to create inline elements
	• By using the inline span element, we can make several elements on the same line and style them all differently
	
		<p>Top 3 things cats <span class="text-danger">hate:</span></p>
		
Font Awesome
	• Font Awesome is a convenient library of icons that can be webfonts or vector graphics.
	• These icons are treated just like fonts.
		○ We can specify size and they will assume the same size as their HTML parent
	• Link Font Awesome in via a link element
		
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.1/css/all.css" integrity="sha384-50oBUHEmvpQ+1lW4y57PTFmhCaXp0ML5d60M1M7uH2+nqUivzIebhndOJK28anvf" crossorigin="anonymous">
		
	• The i element was originally used to make other elements italic, but is now commonly used for icons.
		○ We add the Font Awesome class to the I element to turn it into an icon
		
		<i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i>
		
		○ The span element is also a good element to use with icons
		
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-xs-4">
				<button class="btn btn-block btn-primary"><i class="fas fa thumbs-up"></i> Like</button>
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-4">
				<button class="btn btn-block btn-info"><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</button>
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-4">
				<button class="btn btn-block btn-danger"><i class="fas fa-trash"></i> Delete</button>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		○ Now we can add symbols to buttons to make them more comprehensive

Bootstrap and Forms
	• Boostrap grids can also be used on form elements to create responsive radio buttons and other form elements
	• We can also add the paper plane icon to submit buttons with the fa and fa-paper-plane classes
	• We can give text input fields the class form-control to give them a better style
