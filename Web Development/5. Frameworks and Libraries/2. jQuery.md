Script Tags and Document Ready
	• In order for us to utilize jQuery, we must implement a script at the top of our HTML
		○ scripts are created with script tags that contain JavaScript
		○ They run immediately
	• In order to get our code to run only after the HTML is rendered, we need to add a function in our script
	• We can give our script a src attribute to link it in from the Google CDN
		○ This is better than downloading jQuery and linking it in from a local file. It gives faster load times
	
		<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js">
			$(document).ready(function() {
				[code]
			});
		<script>
		
		○ Code placed inside this function will run once the page is loaded
		○ Without it, it may run before the page fully loads and cause bugs

Target HTML Elements
	• All jQuery functions start with the dollar sign operator ($)
	• jQuery can select HTML elements with a selector, then do something with that element
		○ The syntax for a selector: $(<elem>).func();
		○ elem is the element we want selected and func is the action to be performed on the elem
		
		$("button").addClass("animated bounce");
		
		○ This would target all button elements and add the classes animated and bounce to them (which comes from the Animate.css library that can be linked in)
	• We can also target elements that have a specific class by passing a string of the class name as if it were in CSS
		
		$(".well").addClass("animated shake");
		
	• Same goes for targeting a specific id
	
		$("#target3").addClass("animated fadeOut");
		
Add and Remove Classes
	• The .addClass() funciton adds classes
	• The .removeClass() funciton removes classes

Change the CSS of an Element
	• We can use the .css() funciton to change the CSS of an element
	• It takes 2 arguments
		1. The attribute name
		2. The attribute value
		
		$('p').css('color', 'red');
		
		○ This changes all the paragraph elements' text to red

Change Non-CSS Properties
	• With the .prop() function, we can change HTML properties
	• It takes 2 arguments
		1. The property to be changed
		2. The value the property will be changed to
		
		$("button").prop("disabled", true);
		
		○ This would disable all buttons

Change the Content of an Element
	• With .html() we can change the content of a selected element
		
		$('h3').html('<em>jQuery Playground</em');
		
		○ Changes the h3 element to say jQuery Playground
	• The .text() element does the same thing, but it will not evaluate tags

Remove HTML Elements
	• The .remove() function will remove the targeted element
		
		$('h2').remove();
		
		○ Removes all h2 elements

Move HTML Elements
	• The .appendTo() funciton will move the selected element to the argument (usually a div)
		
		$('#target4').appendTo('#left-well');

	• The .clone() can copy a selected element, then the appendTo() function can be called to move the clone
		
		$('#target4').clone().appendTo('#left-well');
		
Target a Parent or Child
	• You can target the parent of an HTML element by using the .parent() function
		
		$('p').parent().css('background-color', 'red');
		
	• .children() does the exact same thing but targets the children of a parent element
	• We can target a specific child with nth-child(num)
		
		$(".target:nth-child(3)").addClass("animated bounce");
		
		○ Adds class to the 3rd child of anything with the class target
		○ You could use even or odd instead of nth-child(num) to target all the even or odd children of a parent element
All three options use an array, meaning the "1st" child has the position 0
