Sometimes, you don't want the default rules that TypeScript enforces, that's why the `tsconfig.json` file is useful. It can be edited to change which rules TypeScript follows and you can tell the TS compiler what files to run on and more

# Sample Breakdown

```js
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2017",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strictNullChecks": true
  },
  "include": ["**/*.ts"]
}
```

- `"compilerOptions"`, which is a nested object, contains rules for the TS compiler to enforce
	- `"target"`, with the value `"es2017"` means the project will use the 2017 version of ECMAScript standards for JavaScript
	- `"module"`, this project will be using `"commonjs"` syntax to import and export modules
	- `"strictNullChecks"`, variables can only have `null` or `undefined` values if they are explicitly assigned those values
- `"include"` determines what files the compiler applies the rules to. In this case `["**/*.ts"]` means that the compiler should check every single file that has a `.ts` extension.

This sample gives you an idea of what rules to enforce and still let your creativity shine and you can set thise rules to your own preferences
	
# Usage
By including a `tsconfig.json` file, you can now use the `tsc` command without any arguments in your teminal. The compiler will automatically recognize from your `tsconfig.json` file what specific files to run on.

You can still provide specific files like `tsc fileName.ts` if that's the only file you want the compiler to check.
