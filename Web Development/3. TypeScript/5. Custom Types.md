	• The previous pages have covered all the types that are defined for you
		○ Primitives and Arrays
	• TypeScript lets us define custom types that can enable type checking for our exact purposes
		○ An example of once custom type we've learned already is the tuple
	• Pre-defined types are like ingredients because they can be used on their own, but they can be combined to create custom types
	• Complex types are usable in the same way that simpler types are and can be used as type annotations
	
	let myVar: complexType;
	
Enums
	• Enums are the first and most useful complex types we will learn
		○ We use enums when we'd like to enumerate all the possible values that a variable could have
		○ So far, all other values have been limitless
			§ A string can have any value
			§ A boolean[] can have any array of booleans
	• There are many reasons to define an enum -- a limited number of values a variable can be
		○ For example, an enum that specifies compas directions:
		
	enum Direction {
	  North,
	  South,
	  East,
	  West
	}
	
		○ From here, we can use the enum as a type declaration and the values it contains as values
		
	let whichWay: Direction;
	whichWay = Direction.North; // no type error
	whichWay = Direction.Northeast // type error, not a valid value
	whichWay = West // error, wrong syntax
	
	• Under the hood, TypeScript processes these kinds of enum type to numbers
		○ Enum values are assigned a numerical value according to their listed order, starting at 0
		○ So, Direction.North == 0, Direction.South == 1, etc..
	• This means we could do whichWay = 2 and we would not get an error since Direction.Easet == 2
	• We can change the starting number
	
	enum Direction {
	  North = 7,
	  South,
	  East,
	  West
	}
	
		○ This makes the Directions equal 7, 8, 9, and 10
	• You can also specify each number sperately
	
	enum Direction {
	  North = 8,
	  South = 2,
	  East = 6,
	  West = 4
	}
	
		○ These numbers match up with the keys on the numpad

String Enums vs. Numeric Enums
	• So far, we've created numeric enums (enums that are based on numbers), but we can also create string enums that are based on strings
	
	enum DirectionNumber { North, South, East, West } // numeric enum
	enum directionString {
	  // string enum
	  North = 'NORTH',
	  South = 'SOUTH',
	  East = 'EAST',
	  West = 'WEST'
	}
	
	• With string enums, we must write the string explicitly, as shown above
		○ We could use any string to define an enum value, however it's best to use the convention used above
			§ The string value is the capitalized form of the variale name
		○ This way, error messages and logs will be much more informative
	• It's recommended to always use string enums because numeric enums can let bugs sneak into the code
		○ Assigning arbitarty numbers, like 693458, will not cause type errors when using numeric enums
	• String enums are much more strict
		○ You must assign enum types to enum values
		○ You cannot even assign a string that matches an enum value, it must be the enum value exactly

Object Types
	• With TypeScript objects, we are allowed an extremely fine level of control over variable types in our programs
		○ They're also the most common custom type
		
	let aPerson: {name: string, age: number};
	aPerson = {name: 'Timmy', age: '7'}; // type error: age must be a number
	
	• This can be useful for defining exactly what needs to be in an object when an object is passed as an argument in a funciton

	function sayHappyBirthdayWithObject(personObject: {name: string, age: number, giftWish: string, success: boolean}){
	  let output ='';
	  output += 'Happy Birthday ' + personObject.name + '! ';
	  output += 'You are now ' + personObject.age + ' years old! ';
	  output += 'Your birthday wish was to receive ' 
	         + personObject.giftWish + '. And guess what? You will ';
	  if (!personObject.success){ output += 'not '; }
	  output += 'receive it! \n';
	  console.log(output);
	}

	• TypeScript places no restriction on the types of an object's properties
		○ They can be enums, array, and even other object types
	
Type Aliases
	• A great way to customize types in out program is to use type aliases
		○ These allow us to define alternative type names for conenience
		○ Format: type <alias> = <type>
	
	type MyString = string;
	let myVar: MyString = 'Hi'; // valid code
	
	• This isn't super useful for strings, but it is very useful when referring to complicated types that need repeating
		○ Such as object types of tuple types
	
	type Person = { name: string, age: number };
	let aCompany: {
	  companyName: string,
	  boss: Person
	  employees: Person[],
	  employeeOfTheMonth: Person,
	  moneyEarned: number
	}
	
	• TypeScript aliases are nothing more than names
		○ they have absolutely no influence over how types work

Function Types
	• A neat thing about JS is that we can assign functions to variables
	
	let myFavFunction = console.log;
	myFavoriteFuction('Hello World'); // Prints 'Hello World'
	
	• A neat thing about TypeSript is that we can control exactly whatkinds of functions are assignable to a variable via function types
		○ Function types specify the argument types and return types of a function
	
	type StringsToNumberFunction = (arg0: string, arg1: string) => number;
	
		○ The syntax is just like arrow notation except we do the return type instead of the return value
		○ Since this is just a type, we don't write the body of the function at all
	
	let myFunc: StringsToNumberFunction;
	myFunc = function(firstName: string, lastName: string) {
	  return firstName.length + lastName.length;
	};
	 
	myFunc = function(whatever: string, blah: string) {
	  return whatever.length - blah.length;
	};
	// Neither of these assignments results in a type error.
	
		○ As you can see it doesn't matter what the names of the parameters are as long as the type remains correct
	• Never omit a paramter name or the parentheseswhen defining a function type
		○ The code will not run
		
	// No argument name. Will not run
	type StringToNumberFunction = (string) => number; 
	 // No parentheses. Will  not run
	type StringToNumberFunction = arg: string => number;
	
	• NOTE: Function types are most useful when applied to callback functions

Generic Types
	• Generics are a great way to create collections of types that share certain formal similarities
		○ These collections are parametrized by one or more type variables
	• An example of a generic type we've seen before is Array<T>
		○ This is generic because we can substitute any type in place of T
			§ Either pre-defined or custom
	• We can build our own generics:
	
	type Family<T> = {
	  parents: [T, T], mate: T, children: T[]
	};
	
	• When implementing this via type annotation, we replace T with the data type of our choosing
	
	let aStringFamily: Family<string> = {
	  parents: ['stern string', 'nice string'],
	  mate: 'string next door', 
	  children: ['stringy', 'stringo', 'stringina', 'stringolio']
	}; 
	
	• It's convention to use T within the type annotation as a type placeholder
		○ Later, when the genric type is used, T is replaced with the provided type
	
Generic Functions
	• Let's say we wanted to create a function that returns arrays filled with a certain value
		○ In JavaScript, it would look like this
	
	const getFilledArray = (value, n) => Array(n).fill(value);

	• This works just fine, but there is a problem when you try to define the function's return type
		○ We know it should be an array of whatever value's type is
	• This is where generic functions come in handy
	
	const getFilledArray<T> = (value: T, n: number): T[] => Array(n).fill(value);
	
	•  Here, we tell TypeScript to make sure that value and the returned array have the same type T
		○ When the function is invoked, we provide T's value
		○ i.e.
	
	getFilledArray<string>('cheese', 3);
	// returns ['cheese', 'cheese', 'cheese']
	
	• Now the function is correctly typed and less prone to errors
