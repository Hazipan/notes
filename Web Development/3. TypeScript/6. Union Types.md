	• TypeScript lets us type variables with different levels of type specificity
	• One one side is very specific, wherea variable is one type and one type only
		○ On the other side we have variables that could be anything
	• Sometimes we need a balance between these two extremes
		○ One example is a variable that holds an employees id
			§ It could be a string or a number, but wouldn’t be a boolean or other type
	• To handle this TypeScript allows us some flexibility by combining different types
		○ This is called a union
	
Defining Unions
	• Unions let us define mulitple allowed type memebers by seperating each type member with a vertical line character (|)
	
	let ID: string | number;
	
	ID = 1; // no error
	ID = '001' // no error
	
	• Unions can be used anywhere a type value is defined, including funcito parameters
	
Type Narrowing
	• Since unions gives us multiple types to work with, we have to implement type guards when a function needs to handle the paramter different depeding on if it's one type or the other
		○ Type guards are conditionals that check if a variable is a certain type
	
	function getMarginLeft(margin: string | number) {
	  // margin may be a string or number here
	  if (typeof margin === 'string') {
	    // margin must be a string here
	  }
	}
	
	• Methods that work on specific types of variables must be called within a type guard
		○ i.e.: .toLowerCase() only works on strings
		○ Calling this outside of a type guard will result in an error because it wouldn't work on both types of variables
	• This concept is called type narrowing 
		○ Type narrowing is when TypeScript can figure out what type a variable can be at a given point in our code
		○ This lets us use unions, then perform type-specific logic without TypeScript getting in the way
	
Inferred Union Return Types
	• A great thing about TypeScript is that it can, in many cases, infer typesso we don't have to write them manually
		○ A good example of this is function return types
		○ If a function has multiple possile return types, TypeScript infers the return type as a union
		
	const getBook = () => {
	  try { return betBookFromServer(); }
	  catch (error) { return `Something went wrong: ${error}`; }
	}
	
		○ TypeScirpt would infer the retrun type as the union Book | string

Unions and Arrays
	• We can use unions with arrays by wraping the union in parentheses then using array notation
	
	const dateNumber = new Date().getTime(); // retruns a number
	const dateString = new Date().toString(); // returns a string
	
	const timesList: (string | number)[] = [dateNumber, dateString];
	
	• The parentheses are vitally important to type arrays correctly
		○ If we left out the parentheses -- string | number[] -- then the type would allow string or arrays of numbers

Unions with Literal Types
	• We can use literal types within TypeScript unions
		○ This is useful when we want to create distinct states within a program
		○ This is especially helpful when we need to pass parameters that take very specific values
			§ i.e.: a program that changes stoplight colors would only have 3 distinct values it would take
	
	type Color = 'green' | 'yellow' | 'red';
const changeLight = (color: Color) => { // ... }
