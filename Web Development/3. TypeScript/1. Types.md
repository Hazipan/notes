What is TypeScript?
	• TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript
		○ It is strictly typed by adding types to JS
	• TypeScript has all the features of traditional JavaScript with some added features
	• TS files have a .ts file extension
		○ The file is run through the transpiler that makes sure the code adheres to TS standards
			§ It will display errors when it doesn't
		○ If the TS can be converted into working JS, the transpiler outputs a .js version of the file
	• The TS transcompiler can be used on the command line by running the tsc command
		○ This creates an equivalent .js file in the same directory as well as surface any errors found by the TS transompiler

Type Inferences
	• JavaScript allows us to assign any value to any variable, which makes it flexible to use and is great for getting started quickly in coding
		○ In practice, this can be very confusing and lead to bugs when assigning values of multiple types throughout a program
	• In TypeScript, when you declare a variable with an initial value, the variable can never be reassigned a value of a different data type
		○ This is type inference
	• TypeScript recognizes JS built-in primitives
		○ boolean
		○ number
		○ null
		○ string
		○ undefined

Type Shapes
	• TS also knows what shapes our objects adhere to
	• An object's shape describes, among other things, what properties and methods it does or doesn't contain
	• Built-in JS types each have properties and methods that always exist
		○ i.e. all string data types have the .length and .toLowerCase() method
	• Since TS knows this, it can let us know when we misspell these methods

Any
	• If you declare a variable without assigning it an initial value, the variable is considered to be of type any
	• Variables of type any can be assigned to any value and TS won't give an error if they're reassigned to different type later on
	
	let onOrOff;
	
	onOrOff = 1;
	onOrOff = false; // no errors
	
Variable Type Annotations
	• Sometimes, we want to declare a value, not assign it an initial value, but still ensure it will only be assigned values of a certain type
		○ We do this by adding a colon then the type to specify the data type of the variable
	
	let myVariable: string;
	myVariable = 'Hello!'; // no errors
	myVariable = 23; // error, number cannot be assigned to string type
